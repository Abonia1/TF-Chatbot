Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Cameron.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Where?
No...
What crap?
No
They do not!
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Hopefully.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It's just you.
Perm?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, no!
The prom?  Kat has a date?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Never
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Okay!  I wasn't sure
She's partial to Joey, not me
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
What?
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Who cares?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
And why would I do that?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

I just need to lie down for awhile
I told you
Who?
I'm gettin' there
BIANCA
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Maybe.
Acting the way we do.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
You know what I mean
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Oh huh
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
So what I want doesn't matter?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
We're your guys.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
See you next week!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I am, Your Eminence
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I am busy inside.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Yes... I remember...
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Not bad.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I'm not bargaining!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
He understands.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Colon!  Don't!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
And what do you think Mendez?
You think I don't know that?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
He must be replaced.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
I was all of these.
What about Oleg?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
End my career?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Did you tell him you did?
Describe him.
No, what is it?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Raw deal.
My point exactly.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What do you want?
Then do it, asshole.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Hey.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Don't be late.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Is there a problem?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Shut up.
Good idea!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Shut up.  Look!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Did you hurt her?
Ha. Ha.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
No way!  He's mine!
He's my collar!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Yeah?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
No. I never did, either.
Are you reasonably awake?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
He's got a point.
Yes, I know.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
How many days until you come home?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Fine.
Are you quite sure?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Any clue as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
True.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Hammond.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You're done.  End of story.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Must be billy's girl.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
So you took the rest of the night off...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I lost them, that's what happened.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I didn't have the time.
Shit.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
When? How?
You're hopeless.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
That's the way I see it, too.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Jack?  What was that?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
That's what I always say.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
I brought the girl remember?
What kind of mission?
When is she not in trouble?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes. Of course..
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
This is a police control action..
He's on vacation.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
What is it?
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Apipoussan!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Exactly.
Actually only one cell survived..
An elephant couldn't crack it.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Got it.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I understand.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Amy...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
Any good?
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Fuck you!
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Why?
Don't think I won't.
Of what sort?
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Shut up.
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Pardon me?
Good for you.
Child pornography.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
My condolences.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm here.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
No.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
What?
Yes.
It's been six years.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What's wrong?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
We have matching luggage.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
How did you know that?
Been having bad dreams.
Yeah...I guess.
Me too.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Sobering...
But Dad --
Had kind of a long night.
Krueger is reality.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
But I've seen her grave.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
I want to talk about the baby.
Mark...
I'd sooner swim!
So they caught up with you, too?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Huh?
The sound again?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
What????
Wonderful!
Under <u>water</u>?
Thirty-four seconds!
What?
How soon?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
How'd you get the job?
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Break stuff?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
No.
I want to go home.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
So?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Could be.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Yeah, lots.
Hi honey.
Mel Gordon.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
But not now.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Nothing.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
In the living room.
Everything you know is from me.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
There was something. It happened up your way.
You think Jack shot him?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
What happened?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Want to know what I think happened?
Money.
Not particularly.
Well, I never heard that one.
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Been better, Dad... You?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
I prefered the terrorists.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Yes, Mr. President.
My loyalty was never to my country.
About goddamn time.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
A dubious distinction, no?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
They've gotta be joking.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Yes, sir.
Can't it wait?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
This is the President.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I might still have a few chips left.
That's my job.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
I just wish it was that simple.
Yes I did...
Dunn.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, please be careful.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Maybe.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
I don't want to hear that word!
I don't want to live anymore.
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
No. I'm all alone.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
No.
Well...
Ted!
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Huh?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
I am George.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And still it fits?
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
This is mole.  It's good.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
To the... to the beach?
You must leave me alone on this.
Ss-ai!
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
... It's Harcourt.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
No... two.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Who else can I ask around here?
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Yeah.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Yes.  That follows.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Are you finished?  You okay?
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Stand back.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Just get back here!
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
No.. I've slept enough.
What about me?
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Did you ever have a baby?
Look!
That's right.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
His Grace is very angry with you.
Yes.
A brothel.
A Turkish brothel.
Extremely clever.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Oh, leave me alone.
No!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Why?
I can't write it!
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
Behold!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Ah-ha!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Really?
Yes?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I don't know. He has pains.
What is this?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Ah!
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Of course not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
How could it not, Excellency?
What work?
Who are you?
Are you neglecting my request?
This is only a vaudeville.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I'm too young to be so sick.
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
You go fast!
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
Ah - you've heard that?
Do you believe it?
You cannot say that!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Italian?
Exactly.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Of course.
Bene.
The American? Yes, duck.
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, I believe he did.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Yes, Doctor.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Yes?
Will you give me a break?
I dream of death mostly.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
I would think so.
Lovely.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I'm freezing.
The zoo?
Jack is dead!
What?
David, don't lose control.
No.
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
So they said.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David.
Shall we?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
Yeah?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Walk away, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
David!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Nurse!
I wanted to see you.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
I want you to meet some people.
Hello.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Why, I needed a—
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Well—
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
I want to be near you!
My apartment.
Now?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Got a handkerchief?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Yes.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Happy now?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
There you are.
I can't tell you.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Mine too?
Don't you think I know it?
All right.
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
Well, he was making love to her.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Mr. Williams . . .
He was here?
Are you sure?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
I'm okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Never a good thing.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Leave me alone, Bob.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Nope.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What's going on?
Yeah.
Perfect, Cole.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
I got us through the War all right.
That's it.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Both would be nice.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
On account of we're robbing it.
It's a secret.
What is it?
So?
I think he's already feeling better.
So we got a plan?
I figure.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Bob's upset.
Yeah.
Yeah, Jimmy?
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Boys?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Shush.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Stop it. This is just sad.
You are a hell of a woman.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Right here in church?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Lyla Devereux.
They had to be dealt with!
Move you fools!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
What is going on here, man?
I look forward to seeing it.
I remember you.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It is a nice piece of writing.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I can't believe this.
I demand action.
No.
In English, Pinkerton.
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
Nice?
Yes.
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
Take it off.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You just haven't been looking.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
We never really shared one.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm just leaving.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
I won't...don't worry.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Where are you going?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Maybe it's just the light.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
See you then.
When?
Negative. Cancel it.
Yes, sir.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Patrick?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
You didn't give them a name.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Sorry. 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
No. Flattering, but no.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
You're at Paul Owen s.
No.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
No. I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.
No, really. I'm okay.
No. Not really.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
That's not the information I've received.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Not a big music fan, eh?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Oh well, you know.
Yes, Owen?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
We're not gonna let it.
I know, I know.
Isn't that -- extreme?
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Why?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
He wasn't acting?
Right... What's that mean again?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Oh hi.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Skywire.
Well -- you sent for me.
I'm sure.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You look a little tired.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Wait... He knows.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You're famous around here.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Then and now.  But not right now.
Why would you do a thing like --
But why would they --?
Oh yeah?
No, no. Never.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Gary.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
What does that mean?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Or sometimes not at all.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
We won, Austin.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
How do you know?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Indeed.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Silence!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Show me.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
Have we met?
Promised? Who promised?
Then who wins?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Next assignment?
Thank you, Steed.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
You're mad.
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
I'll never marry you.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
June, July ... August?
Any other vices?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did he say who?
How on earth can you tell?
Is there anything that isn't?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Where are you going?
But --
Still a bit chilly ...
Have you any place in mind?
You're saying I have no choice.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Surveillance? By whom?
... and now?
I shall need a small plane.
So you say ...
Possibly. Split personality ...
Walk over to the window ...
If you say so.
Ugh ...
Really -- you went with him for two years.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
When do the girls get to the party?
What is this person's story here?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm very happy for you two.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Fan out and look for them.
Thank you, sir.
Keep me informed.
1002.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
It looks awful.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
You better not have too much joy.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Your mother's not dead.
I am committed. I love you.
Yes...
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Any time, Al.
Let's see your bread.
Why?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Milt?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
What do you mean, it changes?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
You can tell a man by his friends.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Oooooo.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
What, you've never seen one before?
It works.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
You're selling dad's boat?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
-- What are you doing here?
Jennifer.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Just take it.
Who's doing this?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
Are you going public with this?
No.
Like it never happened...
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
No need to be modest, Brian.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
He's got piano lessons.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
You treated me like shit.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
He works for me.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
And the world -- the whole world.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You mean you could use it.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
You've really got a problem.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Give me some?
Delacroix.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
She's also moorish.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Damn skippy.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Did we get our bill yet?
I'm tired of waiting.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We was coming to see you.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Why?
How you sound?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
We think so.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Break a leg.
Everybody shut up.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I don't want to hear it.
Please don't go there.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
No.
It looks delicious.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
You've never had any formal training, either?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
A song a comin' I feel.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Just ask me what you want to know.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
I have acted as I think fit.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Certain?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes, of course.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
The milkmaid's daughter?
And he doesn't care about me?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you mean, alone?
Shut up.  West's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Just look. Little pocket.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
From up close or far away?
But not the only victim, right?
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Who killed Pike?
What happened next?
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Want company?
Oh, you remember now --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
We're not going anywhere.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
No --
We know.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Edward Bloom.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Why?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
What did she look like?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Stop.
You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.
Really?
What's your name, Giant?
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Am I?
You think I'm up for it?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
Really.
I will.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Yes.
Can we talk?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
How what happens?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
You say...
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
They're your favorite flower.
Go out with me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Really.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm robbing this place.
Hello.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You don't have to.
Did you?
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm, what?
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
What for?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Thank you.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You're asking for my documents?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
What? What does he want?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Well as it turns out I did.
No I don't.
So you're just going to be vindictive
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Why?
So now you hate all women?
Get out
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
This gonna get you in trouble?
You liked what I brung ya?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
You gonna miss your bus.
She's around. Always is.
I got others.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Rose... please...
LAZ, I said let...!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Whose doin' is that?
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Let go of me...
You drink whiskey?
Nothin'.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Not like that.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Got in a little accident.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Thought you had a man for that.
Home.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
-- I should tear your head off.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Number five with a bullet.
Let's grab some food.
I hope not.
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Cool?
I wasn't expecting you.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
What's the problem here?
I don't, that's all.
I stole them.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Ichiro --
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
What...?  Why?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
Why would you care?
Save it, I already took the tour.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Why?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
You're foreigners.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
You want him dead too.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
I am?
Dr. Tyrell?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Yeah.
Soon as I finish the job.
I know all that.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
Do you recognize any of them?
What did she want?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Of course not.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I work alone.
So?
You did?
If they are smart, they take naps.
Like?
Hmmm?
No, I don't.
What difference will it make?
What?
Go ahead.
What desert?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
They left.
Is that why you're still here?
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
Really?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Young man, stop right there!
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Yes, I'm right?
Get away from me!!
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
I know a short-cut.
No.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
The engine is still running.
I told you I've never driven before!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Look unimpressed.
And don't be so obvious!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
No.
Yes, it is.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Tempus fugit!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
I promise. Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Uh, I think they have.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Almost all of them.
What?
Thirty-five.
Up there!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Sorry, Mom!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
You bet, hon!
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
If he tells, it won't come true!
Just open the door.
Mutants?!
No.
I don't believe it!
We do?
Excuse me.
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
We did not leave together.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He left with Sophie.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Coward!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Have him committed.
What?!
Where?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
It must be great.
Okay.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Nobody.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I, I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
No, please. I won't.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
I, uh.
Same here.
Who's it, you mean.
Please, please stay.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. Are you?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don? Where is he?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Nothing.
Mom.
This is it.
Yeah.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
I'll drink to that.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Where's your gun?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We... met them last night.
Our mother can see through bags.
Right.
Shut it. It's Ma.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
For what?
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
A-fuckin'-men!
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
You... oh god, why?
You killed my... my...
Pee...Per...Man.
What about one guy with two guns?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
We promise.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
So?
What the fuck do you mean?
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You believe?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes.
What do you want me to say?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
The... The funny man.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Right. The blond guy.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I heard that.
You think we're going to be chased?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
I'll say it.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
What. What's the matter?
No kidding.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Bob!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I did.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yes. I do.
Hang on a second.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't know.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll see you there.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Behind Bob's house.
You're kidding.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Yes, he did.
That sounds like Dignan.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I hope not.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
OK, Dad.
He looked too shaken-up.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Who's got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Uh-uh.
What do you mean?
The front stairs.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
That's your friend Anthony?
I don't know about that.
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I can't believe you said that.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
His name was Swifty?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
I told you they were there.
There were more than that.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I don't know.
I can't do that, Bob.
You don't even know his name.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
Yeah?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Where's Applejack?
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Now!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Where's that guy going?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Got a little lucky.
There was a mistake.
Anything else?
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
No. You lost your way.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Then what?
You killed them.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- not yet --
Tell me later.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Who is Pamela Landy?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
No. You never worked Berlin.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Sounds like a threat.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
What? The tapes?
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
And why is that?
So?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
I don't want to leave.
It was in Latin, sir.
We cannot defeat this --
It is suicide.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's followers.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Aye.
I rest.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We don't split up!
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I... accept your proposal!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
What is it?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
It's coming... argh! I can't!
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
I thought you were a December baby.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
You'll see.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I walk differently?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Yeah?
Know what?
Which is?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Gee, thanks friend.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
No.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry. It is.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Come up here a minute.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Er, my check, please.
Practically no one.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You needn't be concerned about me.
No.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It doesn't matter.
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
We'll discuss it later.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
He came from Paris with Rick.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Yes, I get the point.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I slept very well.
-- Thank you.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
I see what you mean.
Our entertainment is enough.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
What friend?
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I never make plans that far ahead.
There seems to be no secret about that.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Put that phone down!
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
No, I don't.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Feels so good to lie here.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Take it, damn it.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Okay.  Sure.
They're harder to do than they look.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Cold.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Could you watch Jango?
Yes there is.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Let's eat.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
What about the sender?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
We're on.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Forty-three days.
What?
Deep, real deep.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor!
Better than I can!
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Really?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
A B-24 Liberator.
Really! Is it serious?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Actually, I volunteered.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
That's it.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Why was he missing for twenty days?
We see you next harvest.
It look nicer then home!
What view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She took off in the night!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Isn't it always?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
That's it.
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
I think I just broke my hand.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Uh-huh.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Intuition.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
What about what?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Escorts!
With identification.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Keep it up.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I can handle it.
It's not history.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
That's it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Goodnight.
It's the tension.
I can imagine.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Sorry.
I don't know anything about it.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
A couple I know are getting married.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Not particularly.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Fine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion, stop this.
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
You were talking in your sleep.
Never. Why do you ask?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I hate public transport.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Absolutely not.
That's fine.
I'll watch.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
You're serious.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What about my neck?
Let it go.
What for?
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
Who did it? Tell me!
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Nice car.
How long have you worked at the casino?
You're talking about complicity.
Good call. Help yourself.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'll tell you later.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
I don't gamble.
Fine.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Does he win?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
All right, then...
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Energy shielding positive function.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb?
And I saw that I was alone.
But how do you know you exist?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
That is correct.
Yes, well...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Any of 'em any good?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Talk to the bomb.
No?
I'm on a break.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
What the hell are you doing?
Leave.  Now.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I got overhead...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Whoever that is.
Wasn't that hard.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Bent?
No, I meant this.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
You did go through my stuff.
How much do you know?
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Somebody's got to.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
I don't know what to say.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
A friend of your fiance's.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
You did.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Then what?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You know what I'm saying.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
You get it when I get her.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
I was on call. 
He's sick.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Theo's dead.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
One more time in English.
YO, DOOFUS!
Check!
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Uhh... nothing.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
That's it?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
A bustier?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You'll know soon enough.
Take it off. I want to see you.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
You mean soap?
Why is that?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Yeah?
Why?
Are you okay?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
But you're OK?
Why? Is this about the book?
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Where it came from?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
But you were punished.
God exists because you're horny.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Come again?
Frank?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I guess they made him do it.
Kitty...
Beg pardon?
Go back to China, bitch!
No more fuckin' for her.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Airport Ho-Jo!
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
What?!
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
I love you much.
We was robbed.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
So? Be real easy.
Okay. Take her purse.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Becky was my only shot at state!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
He should be king!
And everything.  He should be king!
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
"My"...
All right -
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's not bad for any day.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Go ahead.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
Yes.
Bah!! 
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I still like UPSTART the best.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Well, these things take time.
And here are my mother and father.
Hmmm?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Did you see it?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
And what was that, John?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Not at all, John.
Oh yes.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Fine.
No, he's very upset about something.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes. John wants it.
And who might you be, sir?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
But, Father, it IS!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
It was different...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Why?
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Yes.
You don't love ME.
About raping me?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
He was lucky...  Sit there.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
No.
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Sorry!
The sun! That's it!
So?
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Just say something cheerful.
I was sitting there.
Over the Edge of the World.
Bye... sorry...
The Dragon...
Do what?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it!
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
How can we stops him now?
Help!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility...
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Helpless...
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
Me too.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
Hi.
You were not.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
I don't know what that means.
Yes?
That's okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You know Wilmont?
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
No.
I think so.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
You'll call me, right?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I don't want to talk about this here.
No, it isn't that.
Yeah, Tangerine?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Really? Is he cute?
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
But you weren't. I could tell.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Not yet. Not married.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I know.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
What are you doing?
Tomorrow?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I just walked in.
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
It's too late.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Well... I did.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Sorry. I just --
'kay.
I better do this, Stan.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Go.
You better go.
Hi.
Nothing.
It's no big deal.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Just wanted to let you know.
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
About...
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Well.... er...
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Your ranch?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
I don't know anything about it.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Coop, where are you...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
Hurry.
Trauma.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
No.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Thank you.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Start the countdown.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
...you okay?
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
That's enough!
No, no, we just got her back together...
Let's go.
We're all here.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
No. It was someone else.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I did.
It's cold.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
Oh, he did.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
You'd never know it.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Five times.
This makes five.
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Last one down springs for room service.
Oh, it is.
But all these people...
Please tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What? What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
Of course. Of course.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sure.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Of course.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Manager!!
Why can't you do it?
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
But they weren't mine.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Dad says!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
I know what I look like.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I didn't see you this morning.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone. It's Mark.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
No Damone. I don't understand.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive -- what is that?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
All right.
They're fuckin' with us.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Really?
No way! He just called him a dick.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
What do you think it is?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
That's the name they gave me.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
All right! Oh, yeah!
I know, everyone says that.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Sure thing.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Not for me.
Righto!
Crying? Why was she crying?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Dobermans don't talk.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
A major!
Naw! Not a major.
Really?
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Damn right!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Why what?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Lucy is looking for you.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Right!
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Part of what?
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
You and a lot of other people.
We can't risk letting them in.
Her fella.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
And the rest of 'em?
Follow me.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Shit!
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Oh yeah?
My truck.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
But --
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What?
Two.
Whoa!
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
Duh hickey.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Amazing you made it this far.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
And the last one is the...
That's fine.
Wait God-dammit!
That's one piece of four problems.
Well...
I said I'm not lying.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
My clothes?
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I'm not!
What?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Showdown.
Dick, we need some time apart --
What night?
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
But I'll never win that.
Really?
No. Never.
Be careful, Francie.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Thank you.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
What happened to him?
What?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Yeah.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Think I'll have a glass.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
And?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
No.
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
...You will.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
I have!
Don't I know you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
I see.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
No! No!
Worse.
How did you find me?
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
There, there... shhh...
And you look so lovely.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
So do I.
It is
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Now husband and wife.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Very well then.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I resent God's monopoly.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Despite the lack of challenge.
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Artist.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Good point.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go take a look.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Get behind him more.
Dancer.
Whatever you make yourself.
Ned!
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Umhummmmph.
Whassamatta?
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
That's thirty percent.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Have you ever been there before?
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
He's my son.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
In heaven.
I was a minister.
Yes.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Okay.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Anytime.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
-- you got your shower --
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
No.
Feels good.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
-- This conversation is over.
How do you know?
She's in the other room.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
This ain't the time.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
We are?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
It don't look together.
Yeah.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Thank you, sir.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Across the board, sir.
I'm not sure what --
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Absolutely not.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I saw an article...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
That's a good story.
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
I think you look beautiful.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
The first female President?
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Are you sure?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
We? I don't think so.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
I don't think so.
Me too.
I'll try.
They are with me!
Get your people out of there or I will.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Oh.
Are you sure? How do you know?
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
You were right.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Just don't.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
"Just!?"
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
I played Richard III...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
You have a better plan, Alex?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Lt. Madison, GO.
Up.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
The enemy is matching velocity.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason..
JASON...
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Nothing. Hold please.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Gwen...
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
Well... Sort of...
But... Inside, I have seen-
You can oc that?
Wh... Where are we?
It's as far as it goes!
Okay, let's go.
It doesn't have eyes.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You seem pleased by the prospect.
The army can survive without me.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
No.  I guess.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
We better, Congress invented him.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
To hell with Arnold...
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
I'm not sure.
Who's in command out there?
Lafayette is a child!
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
The man is a traitor!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I... they look both the same.
I rode here, on my horse.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
General Lee, sir!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
I'm very aware of that.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
We're leaving them?
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
You know very well who it is that I love.
But not more than your comfort.
That's a lie!
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Juba was a Numidian.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Come here, Farrah...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Not too bad.
Your who?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Harry, let me answer that.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
That's all.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
In the can. That the money?
You serious?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Depends. Who's this?
Ray. Look at me.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
He owes me money.
That's right.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I know what a marker is.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Who's the star?
So what's the problem?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Let's see how we get along.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
He died.
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
They report it to the IRS.
Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
...That's what we finally decided.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
And you think the movie business is any different?
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You bet.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
I'm going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -–
That's where you got the idea?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
That's what it says.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
What?
Maureen?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Seen a lota movies.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
It looks like it.
How about you Epps?
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
How do you mean?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Probably didn't have time.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Yeah. Thanks.
You're more practical than superstitious.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Collision? With what?
Wish I could say the same.
Showing you what?
Just lucky I guess.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
What do you say, Dodge?
You got that right.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Drink up then.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Shut up.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Fine with me.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Nothing.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
Well, yes...
Huh?
Help me what?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
I guess.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Good.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Okay, okay!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Everybody's too stupid!
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Wait...
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Go ahead...
Great...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
It's fine.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Maybe an orange juice.
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Well, we won't keep you.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Did you bring that tape?
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
NO!!!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Yeah, well...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Yeah, but still...
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Oh yeah?
YAAA!
Really?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
In whatever way you think I mean.
Do you have anything to drink?
So where would we go?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
I wish I could see him.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
That is correct.  Nothing.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
I can try.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Don't they have to be?...
You think they'll come then?  Why?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Since his beard was red.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
We definitely had a moment or two.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Good-bye, Peter.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
What are you doing up here?
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Do it!  Just do it!
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
I hate Jello.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
She's new in town.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Eight o'clock?
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
What?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Print is dead.
Has this ever happened before?
I'm not at liberty to say.
No, you may not.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
See!  They are using drugs.
That's "Peck!"
Yes.  I don't like this.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Why not?
Does she want to be?
I agree.
Oh, shit!
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
God, it's ugly!
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
That appears to be the case.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Judgement Day ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Yes?  Go on!
That's difficult to say, general.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
You're hearing about somebody else.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Why you?
Why do you play at being drunk?
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
My troops don't make policy.
I was summoned.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Greeks?
I can see that...
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Don't be ridiculous.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
No.
No.
No.
I just want to tell you something.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
Wait a minute.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman. The older woman.
Oh my God --
At the Zoo.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Elaine -- I love you.
Did you say rape her?
You've got to tell me what she said.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
But Elaine --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Thank you.
Mr. McQuire.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
A single. Just for myself, please.
What?
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Is what a girl?
Why not?
I'm very neurotic.
What do you mean?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Pardon?
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Where is it?
A drink? Of course.
The number.
Benjamin.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
Is this -- what?
Wait a minute!
INADEQUATE!
If you want.
How about art.
Neither.
I don't.
Yes I do.
What one.
There's no risk?
He's asleep.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
About five years.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Why not?
Then let's hear them.
Don't start acting hurt.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'll find her.
Goodnight, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
What about it?
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Ben -- how old are you now?
How long have we known each other now?
Yes, sir.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Can you look through the glass.
I'd like to discuss this.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Yes.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
I could take care of her.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
You might find a bullet through that head...
Who?
Have you seen it?
Oh -- work!!
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Where downstairs?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes --
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
Yes -- I do understand.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Oh -- 
For Vienna?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
We could come to my room.
All right then.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Don't do that. 
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
This gentleman can have my room.
Send his bags up to my room.
Stay where you are.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Have you got it now?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Definitely off.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Well, he's a gentleman!
Why not?
Shhh -- here he is now.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
All you have to do is phone for it.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Then, it's all over?
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
We did not approach you.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Oh -- but it can't be.
I wish to be alone.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
I don't know you.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Me?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
My son was in the hospital --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
I like you, too.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
What? He's going to be all right!
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
It's not your fault.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
I pay my debts.
Well, that's good news.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Never.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
I don't?
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
This time...
In your other hand.
Mm?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
I want to know everything about you.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Mama!
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
You already went back to work.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Open your door.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
) What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
No question, huh?
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Charming.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
You're so predictable.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Yes.
Where'd you get it?
Why not?
Then you come out here.
I'm okay.
It's always John.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What?
What is it?
Can't you hold it?
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
He's in the bathroom.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
You can't expect us to stay here --
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Danny!!!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
This is madness, Wynn.
Why did you take Jamie?
Jamie's baby ...
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
Must have changed that law.
Tell them yourself!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Go home!
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
I dunno.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
They were enemies.  We were at war.
You've come to the right man.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You actually sold insurance!
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
He worships Father.
They were in the same creative writing class.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
What's good about that?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
"The sting."
"The sting."
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Mhravitch.
I don't know.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Who was it?
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
What time do you get off work, my child?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Daughter--I love you very much.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Turn around?
I have a brain.
What a honeymoon.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I see.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Like what?
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No.
Load it for her.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Oh dear.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I was going to ask.
You were wrong, you quack!
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
We'll find out now, won't we?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
I'm utterly satisfied.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
No!
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
I've enjoyed being man.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Ja?
Don't worry about it.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
It's beautiful.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Then get him.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
Keeps fairies away!
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Doing what?
That's something I suppose.
I know.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Take plenty of cigars.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
Meaning?
I'm amazed.
We've got to rescue him.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Not true.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
What are you doing?
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Yeah, yeah...
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Sam?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Ulcers.
A friend.
At least I'm a growing person.
What rate?
You don't understand shit.
Tijuana.
I thought I was fucked up.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
...What do you have to offer?
That's right.
What have you found out?
What do you mean?
Hmm.
Who made it?
What do you mean?
Do you think she's safe?
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
Yeah.
Rucker.
Let's go.
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know nothing, man.
No.
That's all right.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
To anybody.
You working in San Diego now?
No.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
No, no. I just took it.
None of that, lady.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Lady! Be quiet.
What kind of a car is it?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Nice to meet you.
No.
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Look.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But what?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Of course.
I like you, Maude.
Well, why don't you?
Where's that?
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
What is it, Harold?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Maude.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Can't complain.
No. My uncle.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
To pit your own life against another.
Another man's life in your sights.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Oh yes. That's fine.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
Then why are you here?
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Yeah.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
See what??
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Red, I found something --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Who wards off demons.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
We're on the move.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I knew those men better than you did --
Don't move. We --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Shh! Just a second.
Not hungry.
Alone?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
I like that...
Doesn't sounds like him.
I know.
Two steps back, please.
We're leaving.
Uh-huh.
Julia's my second wife.
No!
HE did. I've seen him.
Stay the fuck away from me.
I have to speak to my father.
No.
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Poor baby.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Tell me who you are.
Ssh!
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Not know.
Who did?
I don't.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
There's very little I can do about it.
I have to see my father.
Oh my God.
It's just been empty a while.
You mean we're moving in?
I cut myself.
I'm here.
O.K.
O.K.
Fine.
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
Not much.
There's a first time for everything.
Do you care ?
Maybe I will.
What happened to me?
I won't be a moment.
Daddy?
YOU'D like my room.
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
I don't believe it.
I thought we'd lost you.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no.
Your father told me you were working here.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
What's next?
Well what's the point in that?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Oh, so what's the point then?
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
How do you know about that?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're getting that anyway.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Why?
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Yeah.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Do it.  Do it.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
And do you like it that way?
I don't know.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Fine.  One.
Just ask it!
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I don't have your number.
You still together?  Going all right?
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
I can't talk right now.
Pigsty.
No, no.  When are you going home?
C'mon.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hi.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What's the difference?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
Wanna go to dinner?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I don't know.
Are you persuadable?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's true!
Well she --
What difference does it make?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Yup.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
It's in good condition.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
The boy _died_?
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
I've been to Church Hill.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
You?
You are being foolish.
No one knows you're here?
You're a fool.
You've been listening to rumors.
You are.  Now.
They do it each year.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
All of it finished.
Thanks.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
All I need is for you to check the name.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Why are you here?
Yes.  Always.
What?
No!
No!
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
I feel hardly nothing.
Of course.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Like you.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
We need more time.
Second musketeer.
Where did you learn that?
Kahn?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
MACLEOD!
American.
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Same.
No.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
What's the idea of locking this?
Open this door!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I lost my wallet.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
No. My mother.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
So long.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Your luck's not with you now!
The power of the press, huh!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What?!!
Just what I said. That's what I --
I know, Walter, but I --
Dead?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Look at this! 
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Where'd you meet this man?
The insurance business?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
I'd like to think.
What did you do with her?
Was she? Did you notice?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Will you come here?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Walter!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I'm busy, Duffy.
They can't do that to me!
I think it is.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Yes, sir.
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Now, where is he?
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
My name is Louis Peluso.
What did you do with her?
All right, Judge.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
I thought so, too.
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Ssh!
Never mind! Just play dead.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
Come on, fellas.
We want to see you.
But Grandpa, you said...
Very well, Grandpa.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
No, she didn't.
They're not.
Sod.
Won't they have maps?
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
...and six...
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
Air-raid?
Kiss me Hardy.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
And absent bridegrooms!
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Out.
There, there, my baby.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Look after yourself, Grace.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Yikes.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
You're welcome.
A dead one.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Fucking great.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
I hear ya.
That's nice.
I don't want to see that.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
That seems likely.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
No please, let me sit this one out.
I resign.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
You got to be fucking joking.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
You find something, Georgie?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
What do they call you, sweety?
Great.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Enough with the stupid voices.
No, just a little too old.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Let's go see.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
That's it?
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Excuse me for a second.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui. Perfect!
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Not in front of the boy.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Urgh.
We still have you and I.
Please let me go with you.
I want to be the way I was before.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Really?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
You've got to respect that.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
What's the larger experiment?
We are animals after all.
No biggie.
Yes, and...
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Terrific. Can't wait!
I don't think so.  Why?
Yes, darling.
That's very funny.
What?
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Of course not.
I'm just preoccupied.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Should I come with?
Ummm. It's good.
Shit.
Yes.
Got it.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yes?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Right.
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
Do we need words?
All I want's the money.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
It's possible.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Two.
Thought you only drank milk.
You being cute?
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Why?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Where do I sign?
I been thinking.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I'm a businessman, kid.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
I don't want it.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Is that what you think?
Yeah. Just like that.
Okay?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Half and a dollar.
Couple of bucks.
Shoot.
What?
What bus?
I drink.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Mm hmm.
Oh, I don't know.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
California. Oakland.
That's right.
Game's over, Eddie.
Thousand dollars a game.
My name is Robert.
You're not them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Have you always had it?
Who?
Yes.
You got that right.
I guess you could say that.
Yes.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
If we want it, it is.
What, Jim, what?
I'll take you to school.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
About what?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
The back door was open.
All right.  I'll be right back.
You have to leave the White House.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He's not going to listen to me.
I take it you've heard.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
Did it work?
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
More than likely.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can you believe this?
That signal. It's a countdown.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Checkmate.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
What'd I say?
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Butt-munch.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
How to kiss ass.
I didn't even see them fire!
We should leave too.
Deploy.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Air... water... your "sun."
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Where?
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's war.
How dare he?!
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Yes?
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
We're through!
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Will you take it easy!
Head for the fireplace!
...the solution presents itself.
Booby traps?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
And do I detect a rebuke?
Dad, how can you?
Thanks.
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
After you, Junior.
That was seven hundred years ago.
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Finally!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Yes, I understand.
Lao She.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
You don't like him do you?
Two are still missing.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Their children?
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Just one arm!
THE WHAT?!
It's starting to let go!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're talking to an authority in that area.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
A what?!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes, they believe you.
No... they won't kill me.
What above the curves?!
What for?
Who's you?
Yes?
I just got here.
Where are we?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why not?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Too late...They want you.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
No. Don't tell the guards.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Just scratched my arm, why?
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who cares?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
What is it?
Little late for that.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
You're out of shape.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
What can I do? You're on your own.
What?
...Rene...
I made it work.
Not blue enough.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
What glasses.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
This just won't work.
It wasn't like that.
Follow her.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't worry!
You have to! Quickly!
Never mind, just say it.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
While he makes the run.
Aim what?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Rene?
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
It'll remind me of you.
Oh, I can't.
Dieter?
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Who's our little man?
**?!! 
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
I have a new client.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
Oh.
Well what?
Oh.
I will?
The little man in my...  ...head...
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
You...him...UST.
A little voice in my head.
What's what?
Where?
Do what?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
Disinterest?
You did.
And you, what do you like?
Wanted to get to know you.
What do you mean?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No, he didn't do that.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Get us one.
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
Her?
It was you.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
...Piece of mind.
Why'd you invite me here?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Thanks.
Tear it apart?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It doesn't hurt.
Whoever took it does.
What's that outside, Daddy?
That remote control thing?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You got a deal. 
Monday.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Yeah. Catch you later.
Okay.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No, I'm not...
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
Catch you later.
Okay.  Lowell?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Yes, it's on the stove...
Thomas Sandefur...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Jeffrey...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I'll call you then.
You eating with us?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, please, Mike...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Everything interests me.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Black, black...
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
You okay?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
You called me.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
You're gonna get your fix...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
He --
They hate each other --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Howard!
You did good, Massey!
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
What?
What do you mean, was.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
It's about time.
I said yes.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Why would you be here?
I know you do.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Marylin! Listen to me.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No. Don't stop.
Me. Yes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
No.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want to sleep on it?
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
What kind of "stuff?"
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
That's blackmail.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
That's true.
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Murder?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Dogs?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Jesus.
You used his credit card.
Of Massey Myerson?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Shit.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Yes?
Excuse me?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
I'm not sure.
Video.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Muriel Rumsey.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
The reward.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Do you love her?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Oh, hello, Dad.
Nothing. 
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
No.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
No, I'll go through with it.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
I suppose so.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Huh?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Are you talking to me?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Yes.
I found it on the seat.
Beat it! 
That's none of your business.
Shut up!
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Smart aleck!
Not at all. 
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
You weren't so bad yourself.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
You always want to run everything.
I refuse to resign!
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Raw?
Amazing.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Come on—get in.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Nope.
I'm out! I'm out!
Do you know?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
Just your imagination.
Yeah? Where?
Huh?
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Who?
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah. Come on—come on!
What's on your mind?
Huh?
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Go on, Willie.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Where you going, boss?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Dave?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Why Galveston?
And then Sunday?
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
It's going to get worse, honey.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
What?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Huh?
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Who?
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
We need him back.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Yes.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Was he there often?
And Oswald?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Splendid, love to see them.
And what would I have to do?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Not a problem.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
In his inside coat pocket.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She wants to go back to work.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
I'm not saying another word.
Take your time.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
It's kind of a sports bar
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Was she helpful?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Cash poor?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Are you?
How'd you find that out?
He called you?
Why?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's not really something I think about.
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
More or less.
In the bag underneath.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Set him up.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I didn't say you did.
I know.
Spain.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Can I smoke?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
A Broadway shopping bag.
You talk to him?
She told you that?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
So what happens now?
What about me?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Keep it between us girls?
Hi, Melanie.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
So we need two people, two women.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Man, I don't like that part.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
I can sit through it once.
Uh-huh.
It's a diet thing?
The roller disco one.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Who's arm is that?
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Uh-huh?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
What do I do?
Sure.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
What does that mean?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You know how she is.
How much it there?
That's right.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Tell me.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Hear what?
Beaumont worked for you.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is that what I think it is?
I thought you might be asleep.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And where's Jackie?
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
You expect me to just walk in there?
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
No.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
I was gonna tell you...
Give me his home number.
Where do you want to go?
What are you then?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Hello, Sam.
How do you know?
Me, too.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
How long had that been going on?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
... I've seen them, too.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
What? By myself?
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
I don't want to know.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Who did?
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Where is the lamp?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Lemme see.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Why do you bring her up?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What's he talking about?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I'm tired.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down, Jake.
You know who I am.
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
One drop?
Pleasant dreams.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Hot. Where do I sign?
If you're lucky.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
What is wrong with you?
Where am I?
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Paul Gruneger!
I need to see you, Jake.
Count 'em on one hand.
Nope.
What's wrong?
What's goin' on Paul?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Alright, asshole.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What?
We made it?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
He came for me, I had to run!
Suit up.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
You just keep an eye out.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
I'm pulling, damnit!
No you don't!
Med-kit?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
You?
Old woman?
I get it.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Well, do something!
You lost the charge?
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Small brains make your balls itch?
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Oh shit! There he is!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Ssh.
Then open the doors!
But?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Three...two...one...
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Sure, Dad.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
Who's driving the boat?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Full throttle! To port!
He's taken him!
Do you see the kids?
I never hear the whistle.
Michael! Come inside!
Do I need any more authority?
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
You could say that.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Twenty years.
Is anyone having this...?
You're leaving?
Is that a boat?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
The shaft is giving.
He's under!
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
I don't have it.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I'm supposed to be running.
So that's cool with you, then?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
But you copy my work every week.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I totally heard you did.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Okay.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Excuse me?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
You weren't even alive!
Yeah.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Hey, I like this.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Consider it your musical education.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
What?
What's the matter?
God, you're so young.
Really? Fingernails?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Nothing...
This is the baby. Your baby.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Elbow.
Nothing.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Tore up from the floor up?
Thundercats are go!
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Hm.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah, sure.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
No it is not!
What's Early been in jail for?
Jeez... Adele!
...That's not true.
What'll we do out there?
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Early, sing me a song.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
...Then some.
If you say so.
Thank god!
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I don't know.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
No.
Siesta.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
...That'd be my guess.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes.
Yes!
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
How?
To what? Virgins?
You think?
Yep.
Right.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
I know what you mean.
Bet.
Why I do what?
Why I give pennies?
So.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Fifteen for me.
Hold up man.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. I can understand that.
Yes.
How do you know?
Do you care about me?
No, Fidget, I...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because, you know why. You know.
What?
No.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I only did it once and...
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah is dissdee?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Yep.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
He still does.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Yep.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
Yeah.
OK.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What kind of problem?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Sanderson?
It's a voice modulator.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
You're not going to tell me that.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I've figured out the message.
You don't understand.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Fuck off!
I just can't believe it.
He already did once.
Thanks, David.
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Meaning?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
The most logical choice.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
I got it from the tournament directory.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
Whatever's on your mind.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
What are they, please?
Yes.
Uh huh.
When I was very young.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
No.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  You were talking about chess.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
I thought you said the line was busy?
For emphasis?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
It's not that easy.
But I do.
He didn't tell you either.
Of course not.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Colwyn ...
I know it.
You must move away from the Center.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
I have no extraordinary powers.
But there is another entrance to this place.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I'm not sure.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I chose the wrong passage.
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
I ache with it.
I cannot betray my bride.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
He saved our lives.
You will follow me.
That I promise you.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
We'll meet you at the inn.
A small house.
I ...  ... am Titch.
I'd wish for a puppy.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
With an old voice?
Her name is Death.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is too late. He has drunk.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
No.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Yeah.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Huh... 500 meters?
Yes, yes...
Yes.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
...Later.
A little...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Don't you like me?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Huh? That's smart!
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I have new dreams now.
No it's not.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
We can do it together.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
You like to take walks?
You can change.
Don't be so sure.
Good.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
That's me.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
Tomorrow.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Where am I?
Steph.
Good morning.
Forty-seven years.
What?  Who are you?
Evening News?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
You OK out there?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
When?
Oh, and what did you do?
Can we just ignore it?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Let's stay for a while.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Get up.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
That's not what's important.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Yes, I am.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Just the love in my heart.
Spill.
What'd you do?
That's terrible!
Definitely! I love him!
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Name?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
Yes, you are.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
So?
Your scrunchie?
I will...
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
But maybe it is --
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I got bangs!
You should. Do you have a resume?
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Chuck.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
What will become of me then?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
And, now?
I didn't know... I --
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Gump, is it?
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you care about what's happened?
And if she thinks me a liar?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
What know you of fields of war?
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Something the matter?
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Fire away!
What weapon?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
They've fired the moat!
Never.
Or perchance...
Be patient.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Oh, la...
Then, perchance you'll me.
In the dark... where I join him...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Everywhere!  Ow!
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Is she fair, this princess?
As fair as me?
Dead, dead, dead.
You'll visit again?
Do I not please you, Jack?
And am I not fair?
We wait.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
You follow.
What are you doing?
I thought I might stop by.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
Here, honey!
Uh...using Josh like that.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Yeah.
I can use your mom's.
I don't want you to!
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Are you afraid of heights?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
A violation?
And if I enclosed it?
I flushed it down the toilet.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
how much weight have you lost?
He buys and sells the world.
How old are you?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
What can I do for you, George?
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
To check up on me?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
No I'm not!
I warned you yesterday.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
Oh, okay.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
Hi, Mom.
How do you become something you're not?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
What do you know about me?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
That's so weird...
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I haven't been touched in years.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Where is he?
He doesn't answer.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
Do you remember?
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
My stupid back.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I smiled at him.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I need to know.
No.  Mostly me.
Left you?
Not a perfect day.
You got any weed?
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Sooner than the Fall.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Can you stay for dinner?
This is what he wants.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Dad's home, already?
Nagger?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She got married last month.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Goodnight, Claude.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
That's because I've never been here before.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Nothing.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Still got that ten dollars?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
He does it all by himself.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
So?
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Claude.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
The hell you talking about? What train?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Goodnight, Ray.
Don't touch that car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
So?
Yeah? You and what army?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Rayford!
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Something like that, yes.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Anybody else need anything read?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
All right. Let me out.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
So excited.
Show him Central Park.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
What can I do about it?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
How bad?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
That's a pretty brassiere.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If you want to.
"Octopus people?"
Sometimes, sure.
East Rutherford.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
I don't know.
A black guy?
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Anything to eat?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Your own work?
Just wondered... what happens?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Here.
No.  Just no.
No.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
He was killed.
I thought I had to do something.
Not about that.
K.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I'm going to run.
A Runner gave it to me.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
That's nice.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
How will they know we're coming?
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
All this. All of it.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Not yet.
Oh my... I'll try.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Okay.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
They're comin' with us.
Yeah.
What is?
Anybody else have a key to the house.
As best we can.
Or not so recently?
I don't know.
Me, too.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
We should stop seeing each other.
Pete... Don't...
Yeah. Call him.
Okay.
Sure.
Do ya good.
His physical condition.
No.
Out in back.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
What's the word on the street?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
No... I don't. Why?
I don't know yet.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
FUCKIN' "A".
No, no. I want to go in.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Alice who?
Maybe.
Called? When?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Two detectives are coming out.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Yeah.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
I do like you, Sheila.
Oh, read it!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
I beg your pardon.
Good morning—
Why, of course. Yes.
Yes!
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
I'm thinking.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
All right.
No.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
Thank you.
We follow many.
You have no disputes over women?
Centuries.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Thank you.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Mine?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
Is that all my story meant to you?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Why not?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
Yes, everything!
What if he refuses?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
That was easy. I read your books.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Perhaps.
Cowan--
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Actually, sir--
What?  Who the hell are you?
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
So what's the problem?
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I taught kindergarten.
It was a long time ago.-
A what?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
For how long?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Are you sure you don't?
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Nothing.
Yeah, Kay?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
Will it lower the curve?
I wanna make a deal.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
May I have a look?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
The what?
Wait-- listen--
Fine.  Good.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Did it leave?
They're inside.
Forget that guy --
Wait.
Anderton --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
What --
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
Because I found out about her...
I know... I do, too...
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
It's all I could safely move.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Yes, you did.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I'm not getting halo'd.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
No doubt.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
No maglev system.
Did Marks close the front door?!
That was easy.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
So?
Uh, I'll try...
Wanna hear something funny?
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
Hold your breath, Dad...
He's alive?
Who said I would?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
You're not gonna kill me...
You say some of the children died?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Do you?  Really?
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
We know why John was tagged.
My God...
I don't understand --
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Yes, I know.
There's thousands of units like this one.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Knott!
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Have you been there recently?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
What does he want with a precog?
But there's still the other two.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
When served warm --
We have snifters
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
So?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Bullshit.
He's not doing it.
I love you. Come home.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Draw.
Yeah. Where is he?
Yeah?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Quick drop. In and out.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Where's Ricky.
Me? No. Not really.
Why?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
So, that's it. I'm out?
Then what are you saying?
No.
He'll work it off.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
What drill?
We get it. We're sorry.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Traveling light. I like that.
Soho.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
I will.
Shhh...
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Is that the woman from..?
To keep?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Well, I don't want to walk.
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
What the fuck do you...
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
What did I 'get?'
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
About what?
Back in.
We're getting whacked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
The what?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
Why?
No more, man.
Bobby and Ricky.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Ugh...
The videos.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Why? What I say bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Does anyone want another?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
He had it coming.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Yes, sir.
Solid, daddy.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'll take your goddam bet.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
She ate.
How old are you, Betty?
Are you?
Yes.
Hush your mouth.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
What did I tell you about assuming?
Entirely.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
I say a lot of things.
The sentences to run concurrently.
I ain't stupid.
Murder.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
The hell you are.
Tell him about Baldy.
Yeah.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Are you sure?
Allah will provide.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
What do you want?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[South America.]
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I believe you.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[Lucky how?]
[Don't lie to me!]
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
What do you mean, I'm here?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
No.
No.
I go to school, don't I?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Where?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
No.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Planned what?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
[Yes.]
When?
This is Mr. Creasy.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
He has to go.
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
That's what friends do.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
What makes you say that?
Yeah, sure.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Where you going?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I feel fine.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I know it pains.
Were the lights on?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm thirty-four.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I really should get home...
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Yes, I know.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
I'd like that very much.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Goodnight.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
You gotta good heart.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
You gonna die without a son.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I heard you, Ma.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hello, Thomas.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Home.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
There's only one way.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Be right with you.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
I like an olive.
No, no, that one.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I don't get it.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Same here.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
I didn't mean with me.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Why would he do that?
Yeah!
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Nope, we're assigned heah.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Yes, sir?
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I can try, sir.
What's that, Henry?
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Are you all right?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Oh, I'm sure I can.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
There is no letter.
There is no letter.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
In what man!
A deal?
John Doe.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Where is she?
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
What?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
Why—uh—
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Thanks.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Did you want to see her about something important?
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Nineteen!
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
I didn't see anything.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Yeah, okay.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
What happened, Mike.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
You want a convertible or hardtop?
I what?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Yep.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I think so.
No.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Damnit!
Only that floor.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Scottie...
Use your imagination.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
A deeper level?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes.
True.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
No...
Not my problem.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
At least a day.
What about the customers with reservations?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Good question.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Katie was digitized.
Where?
If she's alive, you get it back.
No.
Who are you?!
-- The inside?
Her?
Yes.
It was a test.
This.  No point to it.
Activated.
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.
-- Standard.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
What?!
They're called squirbs.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Ah... sure.
There should be a way to open it.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
We can take these guys!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Look closer.
Wait for me!
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO IVAN!!
So they've been destroyed?
How'd you know?
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Why should I be?
Could we step outside?
Who hired the bastard?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
It's a mask.
London?
It always is.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
I told you twenty!
Come off it, Bugs.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Didn't know you felt that way.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Jesus.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Stu Miley.
Bend over?
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Got a doctor on duty.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
What's the "bad" part?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I don't think so.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Uh-huh?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
Behind the books.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
And where is she?
Moscow.
This way?
Where's the Majority Leader?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Yeah. Funny--
My friends?
Waiter!
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do we *have* to?
We're gonna get married.
What?
No--not offhand--
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Great saints!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Nonsense.
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Henry Hill.
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Y-yes, Jim.
Ma! Hold him!
What stuff?
Than what?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Mr. President!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
I yield.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
No, Jeff--please--!
What?
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
There *what* was?
Well--he's got nothing on me.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Punch?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Why?
Why?
Yes, I see that.
The Steering Committee.
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
No.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Have I?
Go right ahead.
It *is* not!
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Great.
Do you want to dictate them?
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Wonderful!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Yes, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Let's get away from here. 
Susan!
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Go away, Nosey.
Okay. See you here.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
It's crucifying him--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Sometimes he whistles.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Uh-huh.
Yes, indeedy.
Yes, sir.
No, no children.
Thank you very much.
Your Honor!
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!!!
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
What did they say?
Uh-huh.
Nothing—
What did he play?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'd like to read it some time.
No. It's nothing.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
We're not going out tonight.
Hello.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Last night he proposed to me.
Yes.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Hurry up!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
What?
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
All set.
Okay.
Yes.
All right.
What for?
No, thank you.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Huh?
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
What're you talking about?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
We own an opera house, don't we?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Uh-huh.
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
A child? My uncle's?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Huh?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Not at all.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, sir.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
Who?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Hmm?
Really? You think so?
You must have been concerned.
Doubtful. What did he say?
Uh-huh.
Why's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
My approach?
Mr. Follett.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My pleasure.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Nope.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
...And?
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Don't need it.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
No, I really don't.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
I don't know if --
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Hello.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Which show was that?
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
It's my bit for the community.
True. Should we stop them?
Uh-huh.
No again?
He agreed?
Nah... scotch.
Is that the question?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Really?
It's not?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
You were messed up, man.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
That'd be Lily.
No... no training.
You're completely reliable.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
What'd I do?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Relax, I got him.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
What is he doing here?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
You will not believe it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Broad?!
Want to know?
Really want to know?
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Who was talking about what?
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No you're not.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Still...
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
You have got to be joking?
I'm his daughter.
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
Me, too.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Doctor Heller?
Thanks.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Frankenstein!
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Why?
I just want to be a superhero.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Monica!
Yes.
LOOK!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Not a chance!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Oh shut up.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
Anybody got any?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Ow.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I always knew that you were special.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Through there!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
And, what a delightful idea!
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
No, thank you.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
That is incredible.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
It is the work of incendiaries.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Lisette.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
No...
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I don't understand you.
I know what you're doing in there.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Certainly.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
I know.
Yes?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
Yes, I do -- very much.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
We have a treaty with Austria.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Anything you need.
Thanks, Unc.
I don't know!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
Cheeco.
I know, be still.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
You already in.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't know yet.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
I do.
It's alright.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Excuse me?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
What up, bro?
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
I know.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Why did he go in the house?
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
Keep pushing.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Huh?
I'll take you later.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
I got my mase.
What's the matter?
Elroy.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
What?
San Diego.
Oh, yeah?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
For not believing you.
Same to you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes, I'm listening.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Tell me why he's dead.
Keep your voice down.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
All right.
I remember. The big tipper.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
That's right.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
What!?
Thanks for the tip.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Everybody does?
Laughs.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
Where?
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Only you.
Yeah.
He carried on some; kicked.
Hm!
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Yes! Yes!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How do you mean?
A man of the Cloth?
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Mister Powell!
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You better not sing that song.
'Cause you're too little.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Ssh...
Dead.
No. No.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Yes. Yes.
I don't know nothin'!
Come to me, boy!
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
All right.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
No. No one never did.
She turned me out of the bed.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
I'm through, Harry.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Where's she at?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What's wrong, John?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Thank God.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Jesus.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
Okay, okay.  I think.
No.
Hi.
You do?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I --
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Deal.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
Krueger.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Right.
Nancy?
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
No.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
I have nothing to hide.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Tell me... what else did you have?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Positively not!
I can tell you exactly.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
No, no.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
With two f's, if you please.
I must be stern with you.
The Duchess...
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
That's all right.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Certainly.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Count d'Algout...
That's perfect!
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Get out of here!
I'll send you a muff.
A day.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Monsieur.
That's even better.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
I think so too.
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Gladly.
You're welcome.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
How long does it take a man to land?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
The bayonet? Did you really?
The telephone is ringing.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Yes.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
A funny story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Shhh! Shhh!
Yes... a little white house.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Good morning, Swana.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Now, Swana...
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
No.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Do you expect me to believe that?
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Madame, if you...
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I told you to go, madame.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Yes.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where is that?
Where is it?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Jesus!  Through a window?
Mitchell?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
So?
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
I know it well, sir.
Sir?
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
"Security" is not strong enough.
"National Priority."
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir ... six bodies.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
The American people put me where I am.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Yeah ...
Just ... uh ... you know.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
POWs.  And their families.
Sir?
No, sir ...
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
Is that the truth?
I've missed you.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
You.  What' you're doing --
To what?
The "crises"?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
Yes, you've circled round.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Nothin'?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
That's very linear Sheriff.
You sure?
Mm.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
No sir.
Yes sir.
Okay.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
That's very nice.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Yes. Things fall into place.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
That'll work.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
I shall return.
I know where it's going to be.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Yes I did.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Why would I care where you're going.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
You already asked me that.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
Everything.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
The kind with the most poles.
Okay.
When did you last see him.
Yessir. I understand that.
How well do you know Chigurh.
That's not an answer.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
What else then?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I'm a welder.
You do, I reckon.
Yes sir.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, I was just... How you doing?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
...to see you.
"Thirty-two?"
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I'm sorry.
I'd rather not...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Yeah, me too.
All the time...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
What's so special about it?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Los Angeles, California.
Like Rome?
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
...did I win some contest?
The one you were telling me about?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Ahh... my wife's.
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
My socks?
...and put them in your mouth.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Hell of a way to die.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
I know that.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
What?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
A doctor on the show... why?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...who doesn't?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
"Injuns?"
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Gopher, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
In any state.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Helluva awgazation.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Not out the other side his face, though.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
No weddin'.
- in the gods - Huh?
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Isn't it, uh...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Aw, that's all right.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Blooey!
Great.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Naw. That's over with.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
I don't mean anything by it.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
What are you tired from?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Yeah.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Does it still hurt?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
I bet you do!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
A little.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
God.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Adios.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Huh?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
The hell we are.
What?
Open the door.
Got us in here, didn't I?
The crowd goes wild.
People.  In the house.
Shaky?
I'm here.  I'm here.
Shhh...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Blue is phones?
He won't even know who it was.
Stop it.
He --
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Oh shit Alma... you're...
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
What are doing with yours?.
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Who's they?
You know that's bullshit.
You know it. Stay Black...
Look this is bull...
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Yeah... let me think about it.
No man. Gonna walk.
They were empty...
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Well, act like it. Come on.
Maybe...
Nothing.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
No.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
His journals, letters, maps, books...
No, he takes after his mother...
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
With a lace table cloth?
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Very well, proceed, sir.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Yes, sir.
Probably.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Not yet.  What happened?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes, sir.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Where?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
He left us.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
When?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
How many men have we seen die?
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Four, five miles.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
But father, they might come this way.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
Is that right, dad?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
To remember.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
That's enough, Ellen.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Do you believe that?
You believe in it.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Is there quicksand?
I guess so...but...
Because it's right.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
This babe has said enough.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Did you see his shirt?
It's beautiful!
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Yes, I guess I do.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
I'll torture it out of you.
Wait as long as you like.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
Men!  Are you up for it?
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Ceremony?
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.
She can hold a bit longer.
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Somewhat.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
How?  The key's run off.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
I'll lead them away.
Jack!
Yes.
Yes, I have.
Until he's done.
Speak.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Ain't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
No, Icky, this is real.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
That might work.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You don't want this.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Aaabout...?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house?
That's what I thought.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Daniel!
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
On the counter.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
That's right.
The question is, are you?
And you have him?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Goodbye, Stew—
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
So, it's obvious, huh?
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Are you crazy?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Good morning. What does this mean?
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, shut up!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
Is that so?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
I certainly will.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Yeah - go on.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Gloria Golden?
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Dawson, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
I beg your pardon, sir?
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Yes.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Must be my wife.
Hello, Stew.
Yes - and I'd love it.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Yeah?
Sorry, boss—
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
I have it here.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Surely, come right in.
You don't.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Why—
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
All right, Grandma—
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
The name is Smythe.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
No, sir!
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
That's all I wanted to know!
What do you mean?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm sorry ...
I don't know.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Um ... It's ...
Oh, gosh no.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
So.
Why not?
What's the matter?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
That's not going to happen!
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Very well ...
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What?
I thought the books were blank?
Yes.
What are you doing?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
What happened?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I don't think so.
What were you doing in a library?
Jen please ...
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Sure.
Nothing.
Wow.
Yes.
What?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh ... Hi.
What?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Rain.
It was a prop for the school play ...
I'm not sure.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Ooomph?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Just gimme the damn remote!
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
... Yeah.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
I brought you something ... From the library.
TV repair?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
This is "Fly With Us?"
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's really cute and she's really nice.
I'm trying to be your friend.
No.
Yeah I can't.
I'm gonna call you back.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I have no idea.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Where is she?
You're going to work now?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
I don't have a girlfriend --
I have to go.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Sure.
Ok.
....Hi.....
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
Yeah, no, I see --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What?
...yes I did...?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
About six months ago. Why?
yeah.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah.
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
This is nice.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Did you do it?
Why? ...what?
Why?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Sorry.
Hello, how are you?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
-- and this is confidential?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I think you have a call?
That was weird. I meant good.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Fine, thank you.
It takes time to process --
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Hi.
Wait a minute --
Is this where you live?
You have another house somewhere or something?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
What is this, man?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Don't puss out.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Sorry.
No.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
Once or twice.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"Turn you out?"
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You among them?
Do I have your word?
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
I'm here.
His wife's influence.
Do you favor its publication?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
What could cause a tincture like this?
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
And my own.
Enough!
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
There's something else I want from you.
Is it terribly erotic?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
I pray you: be succinct.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What thought is that?
And I in yours.
Forgive me, I beg you --
You've come to lecture me?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
To make pictures.
I'll remember that.
Randolph!
Uh-hub.
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
I am not that woman.
There is nothing to discuss-
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I wanted it
Not for me.
I will not have this in my home.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Can I talk to Hearst?
Nonsense
Like a bug.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
They don't have to.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Uh huh.
I don't care.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
This ain't George's doing--!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Yes
Again.
Again.
Again
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It was a -joke, George
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Yes!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
I'm Ok.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Nothing...
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want the title shot?
You want the title shot or not?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Whatsa matter with you?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
You sound bitter.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
I just wanted to say hello.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Should I hit it?
No.
Come over here.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
With Salvy, eh?
Then what?
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Never felt better.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
He has it. Thank you.
Jefferies?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
That's what they call a family problem.
You think I made all this up?
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
What time?
Not yet.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Ever get an answer?
You figured that out, huh?
All the things I hate.
That depends on who "they" were.
Like an old hambone?
With that cast on -- you don't.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Gunnison?
It's me.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I don't want to.
She's just not the girl for me.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
I was.
Depends one which one.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Would four of them -- ?
Smart girl.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Empty as a football.
Only because it's expected of her.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
You mean leave the magazine?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Three.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
That's what the witnesses told him.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Your name?
Phone number?
A new disease.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Smashed the front door.
Down in back.
I think I should go home.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hold it, Jim.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
That's funny!
I'm not hungry.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
You don't?
Sorry.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
That's right!
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Do you hear from him, son?
Head-shrinker?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I don't want to make friends.
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Not lately.
Plato!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
All right, darling.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Good Lord!
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Pretty mixed up?
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I'm numb.
No.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
You don't need to do that.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You disappointed?
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
No.
My mother?
Gabriel!
Don't hurt him...
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
...whoever she is.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Radio said.
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Tell me again.
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What's going ON!!!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
What?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
You saved me.
Don't say my name...
I'm almost done.
I'm glad it was me.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
The hell I can't.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
Samantha.
Bam Bam.
Hey.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Get out.
NO!
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Six men means six guns.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
'Tis the season, convict.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Show's over.
What... Powwow...
GO!!!
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Five years. Since it opened.
My what?!
Hi, Nick.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
GUARD!!!
How'd you know I'd do it.
I'm ninety-two years old --
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Fine, now.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Where was she from, Compton?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Bullshit.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Yeah.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
What for?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
What? Snap out of it!
Sure.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
No, they're not.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
He don't tip.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
It's a surprise.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Why not?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Where? Are they out in the car?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
As far as -- Sonora?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
His letters will keep.
That's fine.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
I suppose that's my fault.
I'm sorry.
Hurry up.
Goodbye, Mary.
I haven't got the job yet.
Hello, Miss Wells.
I don't want to run short.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
And meet him there.
Swimming.
Good thing you didn't.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
I don't care what she asked you.
What's there to be fair about?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
There aren't any women here.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I sure would.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
No. We're not stayin' --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Thanks, Steve.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I think he wants me.
Alex, what are you doing?
Hello Ray.
He's so brave.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
It looks like the furnace.
Hugh Kane.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Can you feel that?
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Thanks, I'll be fine.
It's the sequel.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
I don't need your help.
My child you are the only survivor.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
That's why we came here, remember?
And sexy.
Second best.
My help?
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Then let us prepare.
"Fucked me."
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Is MOM... in there?
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I'm so happy I could shit.
But, Chip...
You mean for TV or print?
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
It's not fair!!
Marvin A. Pickles.
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
It's sugarless.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Yes, but I lent it...
Right here!
Bon Appetit!
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Yes.
Thank you.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I guess most people are.
I did her hair.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She showed me a drawing.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
But you do believe me?
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Good night.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
We could tell him.
But it's a small room, Jason.
What's wrong, Mary?
They may have been friends of hers.
I understand.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
I should like people to read what I've written.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I think it's time.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
I don't know.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
I'm very, very serious.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
She's not been here for a long time.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
False alarm.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Do you want me to?
Impotent.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Basically, yes.
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
What difference does it make why I do it?
Sometimes. Afterward.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
You said you weren't always impotent.
How come?
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
No.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Mmmmm...
Is that supposed to comfort me?
But I'm not.
Always the lawyer.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I want out of this marriage.
He does.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Then why'd you call me?
Cynthia!
What is it?
It looks like a tablecloth.
You want me to leave?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Why don't you let me tape you?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Yes.
Yes.
I can't talk you into it?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Could be risky.
Cynthia. John.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
I want to see you.
What's so stupid about it?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
I like having the car, the car is important.
So is my wife, asshole!!
Goddamit...
Yeah.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Was he nice to you?
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Gonna cut me open?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Did I say anything?
OK. I'll think about it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
Time to check with Flavors.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes, Betty.
Indulge?
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Sure thing.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Who?
I'm sorry, Officer.
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Do you really think so?
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
No.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I love you.
And?
Yeah, I'm here.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Highliner.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Um... seventy... something.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Want some?
It's not even a mile.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Uh-huh.
Then it's a good thing.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
She works for tips!
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Shut up.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
You have the keys.
Well, she is cute.
Okay! Fuck!
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Is what the money thing?
No.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
I don't have to.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
Uh-huh.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hold on.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
How long have you been into wine?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah. Thanks.
A paper?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Like what a fraud he was.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
I guess.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
It tastes old.
Only for pee or poop.
This one?
You don't even know what that word means.
It tastes funny.
My ballet recital.
Hi baby.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Are you going to do this or what?
I heard.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
Yes.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
I'm close.
Don't.
I have some upstairs.
Don't do it.
That means they're unemployed.
Don't call me Father.
What was the first thing?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
What book!
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Where were you?
You'll never make it.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Yeah... that must have been it.
This is a brutal land.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
No, Leavenworth.
I had to get up anyway.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
He is that.
No hard feelings.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
The other guy drew first.
We didn't get that far.
He'll be here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
It's none of your business.
I don't have any family any more.
Because they enjoy it.
You don't know?
Where's Emmett now?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is a lot of money.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
I run the place. What can I get you?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
You like a good saloon?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
Almost right.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
"Forever".
If it's on the page...
I'll send you her resume.
Even the fall from the plane.
I'll walk you out.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Better late than never.
-- I can explain.
She said you were very beautiful.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
I do?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Not if I don't let her.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Why?
Do what you do to Simone.
Who are you really?
It was more in passing.
Body double.
How did the wall get there?
-- Please, get away from me.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I don't know anything about computers.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Why?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I'm keeping it in trust.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
My God, you've got one?
What do you want -- ?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
But that's Simone's part.
Good.
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
Yes.
Don't fail me.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
No.
I definitely won't.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
I know.
Who!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Chuck E. who?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Sorry.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
I could. You sucked.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Metaphysical question, man.
Harvest moonshining!
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Pardon?
"Blood?"
People say he was a murderer.
Amends...?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
He started it.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
I said that's enough!
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
No. Not without you --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Never.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Why bother?
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Hey, Grant.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Starla, it ain't --
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
We're coming your way, man!
Shelby!
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Yeah.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
What?
What can I do you for?
All the rib eyes?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's disrespectful.
Out.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Grant, no!
Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You know how rumors start.
What do you think?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
They're both a challenge.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Ciao.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Absolutely.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
You sure do.
Another time.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Can a pig whistle?
They're jammed!
Save it. We got a long haul.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're gone.
I'm here.
Yeah, but...
Go breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Pick it up, Breaker.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Now, you just find him, son.
Chickenshit money.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
...About what?
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Look at the collar on that coat...
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Like a mafucka.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
A Fed? Like FBI?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
What!?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
How quickly?
Yes.
That depends.
What was it?
My wife.
To who?
I don't know.
Get out --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Yes.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
You don't know?
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
You... she said I didn't love her.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I can't stay here.
I want you here.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Am I really her?
Why do you say that?
It's an experiment.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
I'm not Snow.
Hard to find doors in this place.
There's a phone in the car.
I'll come with you.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Urdu and Hindi.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Sleep good.
They called here after you left...
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
I know.
Long enough.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Sure we are, let's go!
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
You got no idea...
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
I had to follow her to a store.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
I just sat and listened.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
No. No, that's okay.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Hm.  What a lump.
I know.  I've got one too.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Lemme down, bugface!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
How about tomorrow?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I know what you mean.  I...
I'm here...
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
I know him.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Any sign of our friend?
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
How is he?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Let's talk in the hall.
No!
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
I'm not so happy myself.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Looks good outside.
I don't know anymore.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
And maybe a little something else?
I'll call the whole pot.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Twenty-five.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Yeah.
It's on me.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Abfuehren!
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Say, Schulz --
It's a mouse trap.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
What's the award?
Me? What if she don't want me?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
She'll never forgive me!
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
You hold him. I'll slug him.
It's that song, Harry!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Yes, sir.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Are we boring you?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Thirty-fifth.
What did you say?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Yes, you do!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
HoS qorDu. 
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
I believe so.
I believe so.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Commander.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
What happened to you?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
You're in the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
Why would you want to leave?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
That's right.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
And what would that be, sir?
No.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
The thought had crossed my mind.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Aye, sir.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Locate.
What is it?
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
You said there wouldn't be any.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
None that I can detect, sir.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Sir...?
Aye, sir!
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
That's all you have to say?
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Ah.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Never mind! Hurry!
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
Oh, I believe it.
Locking phasers on target.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
KHAN!
Try the emergency channels...
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Not at present.
I am understandably curious.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
It's all we've got.
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Best we could do in two hours.
Steady as you go...
Take the test again.
HURRY.
There is no such regulation.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir --
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Engage warp engines --
Phasers locked...
Try again.
Battle stations.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'll try, Captain.
Honors -- hup!
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Just a couple of kooks...
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
... My shoes...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
It is.
We're just -- observing.
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Just lucky, I guess.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What do you mean now?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You need me.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
You've programmed that from memory...?
But you said toxic.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Yes.
Ah... The giants.
I see.
Steady as she goes...
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Yes, sir.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
No power to the bay doors.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
... Are you joking?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
What's the rush?
I understand.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Perhaps, that is true.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Androids... don't have...fun.
Bye.
No.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Understood.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
A planet in Federation space...
The Ba'ku.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Fail-safe?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
I'll be in Engineering.
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Aye, sir.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
You've not aged a day since then?
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
What...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Vulcan?
Ready quantum torpedo.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Understood. Keep me informed.
Let's go.
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Yes.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Yes, he is.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Fire.
Steady as she goes.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Just a little queasy...
Understood!
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
What kind of message?
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
Yes...
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Your honors, the State rests.
Onscreen.
Do we report this, sir?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
I like it here...
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Possibly.
Captain, if --
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Make ourselves a target?
Faith...?
Not as yet, sir.
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Maybe we should write them a letter?
You're working late.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Now, you make a toast.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
I know how he thinks.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Theories?
He wants to look me in the eye.
I'll take care of it, sir.

A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Not with the Romulans.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
What sort of signature?
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Aye, sir
Your new chair, sir.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
And the Romulans invade.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
No?
I've never met a human woman.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
How did you end up on Remus?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
But you want to.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
What about Picard?
Should I raise shields?
We're being hailed.
Let's go.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
She is here.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
I have a purpose.
Silence, Romulan!
For the moment.
I don't see anything.
I don't think so... 
I'll have to run your card off now.
No.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
It's in a green Mustang?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No, we don't.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Steering wheel.
Dashboard.
You'll see.
I am...
I know.
My... husband.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
You. Mouth closed.
No.
When we get here.
A baby is a new person?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I do not speak English.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Can I have the gun?
Go?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Why?
Yes.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Nothing.
Do they talk?!
I gave you a baby last night.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police!!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
We're ready.
It could have been anything.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Judy, that's stupid.
You saw that?
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
Yeah, right.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Fuck you.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Forget it's there.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Why me?
Is he dead?
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
I won't say anything.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
She never gave me a tape.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Coming with you.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
She still loves me.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
That's where it gets a little strange.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
How long does it last?  Oh.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Uh unh.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
That's right, Jan.
What's the bad news?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
This is Agent Mackelway.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Not bad, huh?
What's wrong with me?
What do you want from me?
What kind?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
The man knew how to dress.
They're all criminals?
"Gone live?"
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Oh.
What's that?
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
How are we going to find him?
The little piggie speaks.
Yes, sir.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Those were just fantasies.
You? You went by the book?
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
So you're the new meat?
What did you do to end up here?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Shit.
I know, I know.
No. Stop, come on.
Shuddup.
You're money, baby.
What do you drive?
...maybe...
You're a comedian?
I'd say about two weeks.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Tell me about it...
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Oh. You know.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
My pleasure.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Sorry?
Oh... right.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
I understand.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Are you on the other line?
Really?
...the Michelin commercial...
Right.
Right.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I do. Good for you, man.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I just tested for one...
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Go for it, man.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Well, that's dumb.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Damned if I know...
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
You asshole.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
When?
What?
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's just leave.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
I know she's coming back.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
...It looked money.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
No...
No.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...it's on.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
No, just you and Paulie.
We gotta move...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
Sure.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
And with prison record.
Should I bring him in.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Barzini.
For bravery.
For killing a man.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How?
You want him to stay in this country.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
No.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Mama, no.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
They're waiting to see my father.
Who is he?
Yes.  Tell me.
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Sure.
And what do you want for Christmas?
No.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Oh Michael.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
To the city.
Maybe.
I do wish to be baptized.
He talked to you?
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Sure. Any time.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Okay, darling.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
That's funny.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Oh God, I don't think so.
How?
Tom, I don't love you.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I just don't believe that!
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Dickie did it.
And you, sir? Any better?
What?
Shut up! Shut up!
I don't believe a single word you've said.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Excuse me?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
What?
How did you know that?
I know.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Thanks.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
He says so many fiancées.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was who Meredith?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Yes?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Of course. What happened to your face?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Even your fiancée...?
Does he stay with you here?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
That's an expensive gun.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Who mam?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I can believe that.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
Oh. Who was that again?
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Yeah.
Sure.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Is he Italian?
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Yeah.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Huh?
He looks like a killer.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Why, thank you Travis.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Physical? Criminal?
Education?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Why?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
You suppose?
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
I wish you were coming with me.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Delly?  In here.
Well...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes.
I'm not refuting anything.
What's that?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
They're...
Anybody take it?
What.
The G-man?
Sandra Sinclair.
Pete...
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Yeah... me too.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
I thought you...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you.
Yes?
I think so.
I despise it.
How'd you happen to come here?
What do you mean?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Cathy!
No!
Your brother told me.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I don't know, honey.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Right across the bay there.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
What name?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Impossible.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Birds are not bad!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes, very.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
Yes, Mother.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
I don't know.
That's a chance we have to take.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
What?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I don't mind, really.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
How can you tell?
Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
How do you know Annie?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You are, aren't you?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
No.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I told you what happened in Rome!
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Why?
It is for me.
What do you want ?
What do you do?
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I'll get it.
So they united.
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Inland.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
And he'll talk?
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
To...  To kill them.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
How?
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Good.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
It is a pity.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Excuse me.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
I can't believe that.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
No.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
No.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I have other means of sustenance.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You can get out.
He must leave me alone.
Aye.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Where the fuck did you come from?
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
I was talking about you.
I know her friends.
I told you, I knew your sister.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
So you're going to kill him?
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
I want you... to bend over.
Watch out!
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
No -- not at all.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes -- of course.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Okay.
Yes -- I think so.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Who?
Remember those words.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
They would have killed this man?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
He's my brother.
Zero.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
Maximum body-count.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Hey, take it easy.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
I will, David!
Hit the lights again.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Okay, okay.
I told Max eight o'clock.
This is Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Okay.
I thought we were poor.
He's already gone to bed.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
But, Mom...
Do I look that needy?
I thought you said they needed discipline?
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Well, I...
Star.
Me, too.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Because I love you...
Save Laddie first.
So do I!
Nowhere.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I don't know.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Finish what?
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Ain't it there?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Hell no.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
The dogs?
You buy any of this, Blair?
What?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
That far?
No.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
The journey is part of my work.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
But you're only a mud carrier.
But there's nothing here.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I don't understand.
I will...
Alexander.
How?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
I'm a foolish man.
I -- what are you?!
What's happening to the moon?!
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Sorry... I was distracted.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
No... let's walk through the city.
Do you know you were humming?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
I'm glad.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Your husband is dead?
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
You can see so many here.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Every night.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Or mud carriers.
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
Tell him to go away --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
I suppose so.
We don't know.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
I am.  Are you a climber?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
You sure you know where to find one?
And what does that mean?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Sure.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Well, you belong in one.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Yes.
I know.
I know.
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
No, he didn't.
Good. How's your mom?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
I could try to...make it stop.
I never knew my father. Did you?
You thought my father was crazy?
[Beat] I don't know.
I'll die either way.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I did?
Don't you go to jail for that?
The Jacket.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Thanks.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You girls are in some hot water.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
What's wrong?
What for?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Not yet.
Can't it go to any office?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Maybe.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Why now, Jimmy?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Yeah!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Yes.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
I think better when I drive.
What did Darryl say?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
I won't wait up.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
What happened?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Why not?!
Alright, Louise!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
You're right.
Just past Boise City.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Harlan.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I believe you.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Yes, Thelma?
What do you mean?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
You're drivin'.
What?
Yup.
Oh.
How do you stay so positive?
What?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Yeah, right.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Mints?
Hm?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Big time.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Dumbshit.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Nepal? Have you been?
Same here again.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
What's that?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
A fucking moron.
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
No, not at all.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Your turn?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Who?
Four.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Why?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Where would I have seen your work?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh Jesus...
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
You betcha!
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Hm?
Oh great, I ran out.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
No short game.
Toy poodle!
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I wish.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
I think a little of both.
What do you mean?
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
So what's up?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
What does the letter say?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Kenny. It's over.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
I'll be evacuated with the President.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
No way.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
You're sure...
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Just a second, Mr. President.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Sioux Indian, right?
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Seven.
Who the fuck is he?
Beats the hell outta me.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Why?
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Bullshit.
Let's go.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Why should I tell you.
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
She's your sister?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
So they took care of Leo.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
That's right. Turn around.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
I could be, too.
That's all!
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
You let me make a fool of myself.
For what?
The what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You always get what you want?
Anything.
Where'd you get it.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
True.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Your watch.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Right on the flight line?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
NO. NO GOOD.
Roger, I've got it.
Okay.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do I want?
Like what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Right.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
Skipper, you can't do this!
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
GOT 'EM.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
So have I.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Me?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
Over there man.
The Last Resort.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Who are you?
Why not?
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Eight years.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
At Rekall.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Arrest that woman!
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Up to the right.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Split up.  Find him.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
I'm late.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Oh God, Doug.
Doug...
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Bullshit.
Mars.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
Jump!
The reactor.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
Some kind of mutation...?
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Nope, there!  That's one.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
That's the plan.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Great.  Thank you.
Sons of bitches!
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Right.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
No ties.
What?
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Yeah, Val.
God, what a stink!
Could be.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
It does.
Why do you all keep asking me?
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Absolutely.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
We had a description of the suspect.
Not at all --
I specialize, Roger...
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
We're taking the other case.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
But what?
That's why I hate experts.
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Right.
You don't drink "booze".
EXACTLY!
I don't need sleep!
Screw you too, Kitty.
"Painted"?
You tell me, man.
It's okay, Eddie.
See-cil.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Shu Kai Kim.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
That's big of you, Bob.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Objection.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
-- What trial?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Soldado.
Shu's the only one I know of...
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
And you b-believe that.
Blonde.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I want you to kill for me.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Thank you, Carl.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
I am going over here.
Yep, it sure is.
Was there an argument?
Oh.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Smell something fishy, huh?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Any friends?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Oh.
She must have known someone.
Faulty wiring.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Maybe.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Cause I like it.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Maybe.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Let's go all the way.
See what?
Hiking?
Mom... what are you wearing?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Yes.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Who am I?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes.
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I thought I would need it.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I am seventy-four years old.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Nothing further, your Honor.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
...I made a reservation at...
No, you did fine.
Well...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Yes.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
...that's perfectly all right.
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Maybe what?
What...?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Mr. Alito, please.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Yes. Yes, I have.
That's for sure, Frank.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We'd be in all the papers!
Come on out!  We're friends!
All right - I've seen enough!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
It's gone now.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Right.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
He's very excited about it.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Yes, but...
Chase, you'd better come home.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Heather, has there been another call?
No...
Absolutely.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
What?
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
They were safe and could sleep.
Home, that's right.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Coming for you...
Read me some?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
What are you talking about?
Yes?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
It can be captured, sometimes.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Not yet.
Your father?
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
I know.
I just can't believe it.
Figured what out?
I know enough.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Me too.
Yes.
Maybe it's an air raid.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
I can take care of myself.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Why would you do that?
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Trust me donut.  I know.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
I don't have to listen to this.
You know what he is talking about here?
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
Son of a bitch!!
He climbed when he was ready.
What makes you so sure it was one?
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No.  I didn't.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Well... Yeah - okay.
No way... GET OUT!!!
No, haven't heard of it.
You an indian?
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
No sir...
Muchas gracias.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
In many capacities.
I couldn't say, which one?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
That bastard Pucinski...
What I made you do, mama?
You ain't actin', mama.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Here she goes again...
Yeah?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
What's that, peanut?
Hell, peanut...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
You up for that?
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
You mean like pedal pushers?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Come look at this.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You certain?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
You do.
Where?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Under a hundred.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
One bad car accident...
You think she's gonna make it?
Let's get outta here, honey.
Fan works.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Love you, too.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Lead the way.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Shoot him.
No.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
No...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Life is unpredictable.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
She left me. Crabs.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Where would we go?
Tripp, where the hell...
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Only in your bones?
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Ye-es?
Don't touch it.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Shoot.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
No! What gave you that idea?
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Yea, James.
Miss Sloviak's.
Is he all right?
I put you on the floor.
That's a big book you're writing.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Hm.
I don't know...  Me.
Yeah, well, actually...
No.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Kinship.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
I never said that.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
No thanks.
When nobody's looking.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Just checking.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
All right. This morning --
Hm.
Yes.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
About the baby.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Are you sure you parked it there?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh?
I know, but sometimes...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
A jockey? You mean, like --
The perpetrator.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I like the noise.
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
Isn't it?
Is that right?
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's hard to describe.
It's a bright sound.
Yeah.
I fell asleep.
What?
Yes.
Lovers' quarrel?
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
Yes?
Will I see you again?
I said the job is okay.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
No way.
How's that?
No fucking way.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
We have a lot of work to do.
I'm afraid not.
I don't.
What is your idea of being normal?
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
What did you want to happen?
I don't know.
I'm relaxed.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I see my sister.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Nothing.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
It was a small house.
People without cars.
I like the noise.
I get that impression.
Why do you want to know?
You think I have a problem?
I suffer from insomnia.
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
What?
Walter.
You don't really --
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
What?
I know.
What odds?
I'm not scared.
Yeah.
Where're you?
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
You noticed.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
No.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Why bring it here?
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
How deep?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Well, what?
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
And how do you explain that?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, maybe that is better.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
So, you wonder why?
Nothing.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Tell me once more.
It was futile. We went all over.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why all nudes?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Ask her.
Here I am.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
And do you remember where she got off?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Yes, we will.
He talked to you Himself?
Who?
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
Who?
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know... I don't know...
No I don't.
What would you like to talk about.
Love.
Right now?
Oh, yes!
At least once a week.
Why should they?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what happened?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Agnes...
Not at the moment, no.
No.
I can't have them any more.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Because I don't want one.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
... makes me...
I'm afraid.
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
It came out of me.
Because I wasn't worthy.
No.
I'm afraid.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Frightened.
Why?
Who?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Agnes who did you see?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
Marty, what are you doing here?
You got to be crazy.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
When?
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
How do you survive?
Two packs a day.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
That's ridiculous...
That possibility never occurred to you?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
About two years before.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Oh, some time in January.
Nothing.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
And what has that to do with it?
No, it reminds me.
Long, thin and filtered.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Yes I do.
Of course.
For the Church?
My God, you're as crazy as...
How  ?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
I'm concerned about her health.
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Is it because she's a nun?
Yes.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
She didn't want any help.
They are?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
What they like?
Yeah.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Bag-snatcher.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Ta.
But I won't.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
You crawler.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Eh, there's only three of them.
How'd you guess?
Something like that.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
And cunning.
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
What's that mean?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Here, Pauly.
For Ringo.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Like what?
You needn't bother.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
He started it.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Oink! Oink!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
What?
I'm not, no.
Oh yes.
What have you heard?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Aren't we ...
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
You were twanging too loud.
Cattle ranch!
Kill drive engines.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
You want to try?
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Yeah!
What?
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
The water will still recycle.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Well we better do something.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Boy, that's terrific.
I'll come with you.
What do you mean?
Good.
How do we locate the creature?
Oh my God.
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
No.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
We can use the flamethrower.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Who knows?
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
Yes, thank heaven.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Is it still dripping?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Let's get moving with this net.
Look --
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Good!  Moisture content?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Even simple.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Food-storage room!
I guess we open the door and net it.
Let's be democratic.
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Here, carry these.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Better tell the boss.
Okay, give me the numbers.
Too many.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Do it.
But...
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Yeah, I...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Okay.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
How many... how many people are missing?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
And before that?
Check out the tent.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
You should hit the sack, too.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Almost four.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
Lloyd and I.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
No-no-no...
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
Margo.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Where?
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I'll try.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
And cut that out right now.
As of this moment you're six years old...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
What?
See you...
She's a girl of so many interests.
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
What's all over?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Margo, let's make peace.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
Groom.
A married lady.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why you have to go out there.
I just asked a simple question.
It's only one picture deal.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
What did you expect - live sables?
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
See you home...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
Don't be dense. The party.
You were just looking around...
What for?
Probably not.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Oh, no. I see the play.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Eve. Eve Harrington.
My husband...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
They certainly don't waste much time.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Thank you, Karen.
'Remembrance'.
Not at all...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
You've what?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Roughly ten minutes.
Three or four miles...
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
That's quite a change of subject.
Now just a minute!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
That's beside the point.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I promise.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--mine's better--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
We need a sympathetic face.
--you do?--with access to records?
Facts or theory?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
When?
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You want me to be the bastard.
--I haven't said anything--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
I'm so glad.
That's right.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't.
--that was awhile ago--
--yes--
We've just been talking to Young--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.
There's always a later plane.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
Just let me get a match.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Which people?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
How senior?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Haldeman too?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
The C.I.A.
I think so.
I couldn't say.
It is.
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
I did all right on McCord.
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
When so ordered.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Like what?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
That's nice.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You called me Oz.
Then don't.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Yeah.
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
I know.  Hey Nadia.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Michelle.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
For me?
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I don't know.  How do you?
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
What's that?
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Dude, prom sucks.
Observe.
I don't care.
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Dude, he does not.
Shut the fuck up.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Just like sex with my wife.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Andy!
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
A la votre.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
What...?
Where?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Andy...
Oh no... no....
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Andy? Andy is that you?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
How well did, er, do you know him?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I know, but I had to because . . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
I'm fine.
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You must have.
Yes, your highness.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
I cursed then all!
Shut up!
He's her?
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
What?
M'mm.
Who are you?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Well, stop listening to him.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
That movie makes me feel guilty.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Nice car.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah.
Well...
You sure?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
M'hm...
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah!
Oh, all right.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
M'hm.
Yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Of course.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
M'hm.
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Oh.
Yeah.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Holy cow!
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Oh-
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
The what?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Step up here!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I can't.
You have a raccoon?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
You're crazy!
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You'll total the whole car.
We can show her the schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Yeah. Right.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
She was stealing.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Oh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And how's the diva doing?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Of course.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
To dander.  Otis.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Don't you miss it?
Really?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
I love her too, Joe.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Hm.  We should do it again.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Fantastic.  Out here.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You can never be too early or too thin.
He'll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
That is not true.
It's a novel.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Don't do this.
Don't do this!
Me too.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Ah...
Sure.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Uh-huh.
Hm.
I think he's really angry with me too.
That's a lot of those.
A lot of cakes.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Well...wow...
Not good.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Why?
Sally?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It could be worse.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I guess.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
And here they are!
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Yes.
So how much do you hate her?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Why are you doing this?
Invisible!
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Wait!  When can I see you again?
No...as a matter of fact...
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Yes?
Oh no...
And do Princesses do improper things?
You did?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
No, sir!
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Oh, of course --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Why are we so successful?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Something the matter?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Well, I have some paper towels --
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Good night.
How come?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Two o'clock.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
As soon as I can walk.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Pick a card.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Oh.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
That's very wise.
Of course not.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Shut up and deal!
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I don't know.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Oh?  Oh!
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
You too, sir.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
No!
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Yeah.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Sure.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
The party's over.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
You know I liked it better long.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Yeah, we better.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
All set for what?
Baxter?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Sssssh.
Don't you ever stop talking?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
It won't happen again.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
We need all our fuel.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
One for all -- all for one --
No.
Sort of.
Let's talk about you.
A long time.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
I don't believe you --
That we're dumber than we look.
How much is left?
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Not a thing.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Who knows what's up there?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
What is it?
Looks pretty shallow.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
What is it?
Charlie?
Charlie?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
About what ?
Well, he's killing now.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Your daughter.
That's right, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Wh -- what?
I got bored in Saigon.
When did you hear?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
I met him.
It'll get here, soldier.
Yeah.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
How's the pain?
I can handle it.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
What is this bridge?
No. Not really.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What things?
Right now -- I am.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Son of a bitch, sir.
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
89   CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
94   CONTINUED:  
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
157  CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
168  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:  
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
It's exactly what you meant.
Wait a second.
I'll tell you everything later.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
That's right.  You're not.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
You don't know how true that is.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
What are you talking about?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Get the fuck out of here.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Don't be silly. How bad?
I'm a waitress.
No.
Will you please take it?
Carol the waitress?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
No.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
To hell with sex.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I can trust my brain.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Yes. I really would.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Don't want to. I love you.
What are you trying to do to me?
Two years ago...
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
How're you doing?
'Love was... '
Where are all your queer party friends?
Oh, my gosh.
What are you talking about?
I'm coming.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
I know you're going to jump.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Why don't you tell me.
Bain!
You're too late.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Do you want Rath or not?
Know what?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
Yeah?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Ten million --
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Just Electra?
It's not the same, is it?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was killed.
Why?
Why not?
The exotic women.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Thinking.
Yes.
Okay.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
No.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Yes.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
What?
Shit.
Right.
What?
Yes.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Everyone regrets something.
All the time.
I hope not.
Taken.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Go ahead.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Who put a bee up your butt?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Why don't we go together?
Both, see you later.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
You capitalist pig!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
That bad?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Did you see anything in the files?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
What?
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Doug?
Yes.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Regards to Her Majesty.
Ooh, well excuse me.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
What?
Don't worry it's okay!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
But I love you!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Can we charge admission?
Yep, it's all yours.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Well she sure isn't normal.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Just yesterday.
Maybe it is!
Well come on, sit down.
Why?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Heart be still.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Late night.  You?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Later.
Me.
-- Obviously.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Why?
So you agree you need help?
Go for it.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
And you have to meet my father.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Know so.
The world of the dead?
That is my telescope.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
You don't believe in anything?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Yes. And?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why not?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Mars.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
That I want you to take me home.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Yes.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
It was a play.
No. I want what's best for you.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Ever again.
No.
Your parents are divorced?
Praying.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Yes. You?
Then you remember more than I do.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
Yes, sir!
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Oh yeah.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
But he didn't ask me.
No!
What drill?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
What year?
Home, school, here... 
Shhhhhhhh!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
...To be traveled through
Then where the hell is he?
Why?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Marty.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
That's just great!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
What do you call this? 
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
No way!
What's going on?
Not bad.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Nope.
Sure thing. Come on.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What?
Well, I got homework.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Yeah.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
How about over here?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
It's mine all right.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
Vanished. Thin air.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
It?  Who does?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
To get my guns.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Asshole probably got lost.
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Please, Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
Hello.
...Who is this?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
You wrote his scripts for him?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
...Who is this?
What DID you mean?
Well... actually, no Bill...
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well not much.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
That's all right, really, thank you.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Seen a doctor?
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
That's all right, really –
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
What do you mean?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
Yeah.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
...Both maybe?
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
I apologize, Barton.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Huh?
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What do you do, Fink?
Physician, heal thyself.
Anyway.
How's about it, Bart?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
Home. Watching TV.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
No.  I mean it, thank you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What did she tell me, Beth?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Put your hands up!
I know who you are.
Yes.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I have nothing to hide.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
No.  Come in.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
I don't have a choice.
Did you like her to watch?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Try me.
No.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Yes I am.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Cocaine.
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
What is it you got between you?
I feel fine!
Why the hell not?
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Is he dead?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
No. Should I have?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Annina Nosei.
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You name it, I paint there.
How about right now?
I know.
Sure.
Sure, ok..
You mean like an ape?
Who said that?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Really?
What's wrong with you today?
SAMO.
Oh – you mean black people!
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
What who's saying?
Well thanks!
Staten Island would be ok.
Hi.
Have a Mac.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
A what?
I just don't think you're being fair.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
We do.
Have we?
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
Nope, I told her everything.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
It does to me.
Your blood, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Dad!  Save yourself!
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Oxbridge Academy?
What are you talking about?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
I'm afraid to ask.
I didn't kill your wife.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
What are you talking about?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
From the other side of the equator-
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wish I knew.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She wants to kill you.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Adam and Evil.
Our work?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
Recognition, of course.
Mystery.
Enigma.
Just checking, young sir.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Banzai.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Just ones this beautiful.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
What?
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
What?
What are you talking about?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Bruce, you can't.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
How could I forget?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
What the hell is going on here?
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
WHICH CAR?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
I loathe bats.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
As far as I know.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
No one would miss me.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
I feel naked without it.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you talking about?
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Great. How??
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
I said I'd check with you.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Did you really ask?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
David, I'm serious!
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Annie, it's me.
Excuse me.
oh dear.
Ahm.... .
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Great - keep him out of trouble.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Quite right, sir.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Great, good.
Yes?
Okay.....
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, heh heh.
No it wasn't!
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first?
Me first!
Huh huh huh.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Heh hmm heh heh.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-snatch...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Oh, that's nice.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
I see it. I don't get it.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Where did these guys come from?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
No, Jane.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
That's my girl!
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Where are your skulls and bones?
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Maybe we should knock first?
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What makes you think she likes me?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Really.  I don't know.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
Can you scare them off?
<u>Out</u>.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No, wait!
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Where'd they go?
I think so.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yeah.
Good girrrl!
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
You've got to help them.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Stepmother.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I'm sorry already.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
... Straight out?
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
In a day or two, yes.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
There's no need for a hospital.
I agree.
No. It won't do that.
No. I like it here.
I am a very good gardener.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
... Mentor...?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Yes, so do we.
So am I, Eve.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Ben is very ill.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
No, Ben.
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes.
Yes. I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes. It is.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
I said - try again.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Good evening, Wilson.
Yes, ma'am.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
It's not that, I just...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Look, Johanna...
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Good. Anything else?
Thank you, Colonel.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Who am I thinking of?
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
I'm a puppeteer.
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
No they're not.
Fuck Maxine.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
The iguana?
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Let me try.
Let me try!
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Forget it.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
No, really.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
I'm right?
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Ha ha ha!
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Can I be anyone I want?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
No.
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte called me.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Whatever.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Then what do I do?
Folks come. Folks go.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Not like He punished me.
Was a time I knew what was.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Yes ma'am.
I miss her.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning, ma'am.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You was friends.
Ella.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
For what?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't believe that. I won't.
What yard? When who-
She was only-
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
What do you think?
It's the LeBaron.
Huh.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Yeah, it sucks.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
We have the urn.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Thank you, Donny.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
They were Nazis, Dude?
No--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And was there anything of value in the car?
In the briefcase?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
On you, maybe.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Yeah man.
Thank you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Take a look at this, sir.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
It's your roll--
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Walter, please--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
You know this!
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Yeah.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Shit!
...Us? DUDE
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Bunny.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Impressive.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Survival.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
I haven't forgotten.
Nothing.
Like cancer with a purpose.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Fry 'em.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
What?
I wouldn't worry about it.
Where the hell have you been?
Thought you were dead.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Not that I'm in contact with.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Wait.
Don't even start, old man.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're wrong.
You're blind --
Who is LaMagra?
"The Blood Tide".
How do I stop it?
I'm sorry, I --
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Look closer.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
He will.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
I'm not leaving without you.
I know. Take some of my blood.
For them. But for me --
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
Then what is it?
What about the chemistry panel?
What?
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I'll take my chances.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Yes.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Let's talk to your husband--
So whoever built this--
Oh, sorry, right.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
--Nick!!
It's like traveling back in time.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
You don't want it though.
Why is there no "our" here?
I don't know. Nightmare.
--scared the living shit out of us.
--you should get back into bed.
What?
Whatever you want.
--no, what's wrong with you?
Why?
Yeah.
The, uh, blur there.
I can't.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--go!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
--coming out of the water--
--Cotter: shut up.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Down there in the Park.
Next time try putting on shoes--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
I'm not finished.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--oh, Jesus--
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
Then I have no idea.
Okay.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
....I don't know.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's why she kills children.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Shoot.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--it's urgent!
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
It won't?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...You ever get tired?
Abby... you all right?
Abby--
...What do you mean?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Marty.
Isn't that what you want?
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
Going out with Meurice.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
...Hell.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
No. It just made them feel better.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
...What kind of fish?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Right.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I'm not sick.
I've seen a few.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yes.
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Yes?
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
. my bourbon.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
No. Come on.
I . I don't know.
Yes, I like you.
Do you know?
O.K.
Yeah. hurry up though.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
That's good.
Whatiya mean?
Just get outta my bed.
No. it's not Don.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Don?. Where is he?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Nothing.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Am I bothering you?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Why not?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Okay.
No.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
uh uh.
This is it.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Motherfucker works fast.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
What is?
Derek!
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Excuse me?
I see.  How much?
No.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Murder.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Just sell it, Derek.
Try the back bedroom.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
What?
Today.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yeah, well...
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
Dad.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
That's where you belong...
Tuna.
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Why are you smiling?
I like fire.
She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
What's happening to us?
How are you doing?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.
I'll be here.
It's alright, Dad.
Yes, I am.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
So, we need to get to the source.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
And here?
I understand. What's your question?
I don't even know your name yet ...
Not enough.
It's a question of habit ...
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Why?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Cause?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Like cats and dogs.
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Intense.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
No further questions.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Chinese peony root.
No.
Yes.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What changed?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
He video taped you.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You didn't know about it before that?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Sure.  Where to?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
It won't be that hard.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
Are you scared?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you too, Dad.
No, Your Honor.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
You better.  Please answer the question.
I am relaxing.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
I'm always open to learning new things.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Why did you lie to me?
It was a place to start.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
We were here two Christmases ago.
It's not that long.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
No. You can have them.
He's not coming.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
No. We're going to lock this up and --
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Did we want to?
Heat is heat.
That's it.
After the divorce.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Yes.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
No. I was just... No.
Wonderful. Uh...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh, how is he?
Yes, that'd be nice.
I had a temper.
Yes, thanks.
Well, what is this?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Then he can move! People move!
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I can't sleep.
Nah.
They're not going to find her!
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
WHAT!
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Go for it.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
What?
Where we'll always be...
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Back here.  At the end of the block.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Fuck it.  Alright.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
What building?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Not that I remember.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
No thanks.
Should I?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Two point one seventy-six.
Yeah, I know.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
The money?  The money's gone.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar ...
Where, then?
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Good boy.
Yes, I understand.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Go right ahead, sir.
Five.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Lick me.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
All right.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Almost five years.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
For what?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He does it right in front of him.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
What happened?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Caesar wants me to stay.
You're asking me a direct question?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
...which one are you?...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
...they won't let you go...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
So it's time to go home.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes.
Who?  Who came?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Did you?
You have blood on your pants.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
I won't hurt you.
Then I'll find another ride.
I don't know.
What?  Like amnesia?
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
That's it?  Is that it?
I guess.
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
I didn't know this would happen.
-- forget it --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- here we go -- I found it --
Enhance it.
-- I'm on it --
-- he accessed the account --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
Where am I?
I don't remember Zurich.
What have you done to my flat?
Machines don't fix themselves.
...sabotage!
... get to it.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Er, I knew you looked different.
SAM! What a surprise!
Not much.
You got the wrong man.
You killed him?
He's a freelance subversive?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Yes. I'm impressed.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You're the only person I can trust.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Shut up!
Information Adjustments.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
If you say so.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Who are you?
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Where are you taking me?
Suit me?
Well, all wars do -
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
Leave me alone!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Oh ... Jesus!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Don't do anything silly.
Take care.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
The refund for Tuttle!
You are good to me Sam.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Er, yes ...
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed?
Have you got one or haven't you?
Time to go.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He flipped out.
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Dead.
Ten-four, hon.
He's going to be all right, right?
What?
I know him. That's Noel.
Our Lady of Misery.
You look so different.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Fifteen minutes.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
The ghosts--
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
How can that be? He was getting better.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
Let me think.
You're burned out.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Relax, will you.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
There are only ten.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It's not loaded.
I'll put her on.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I don't like the word gay.
Ravenous homosexual.
Sure.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
They're not that dumb, after all.
You too.
No.
I'm not kidding.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
You didn't say anything to her?
No.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
And Bobbie says...
We could...
Should I...
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
That's okay.
Oh.
Okay, sweetie.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Fill for a second.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I was a lot earlier.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes, sure.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
So great -- right?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Hey?
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
Okay.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Who?
Well...
Because you're nuts.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I just might.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
You're breaking my concentration!
Is the manager cooperating?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Murdered man.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Now you're a professional!
Every word...
Hm...
You think I'm creative?
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
No! I want to talk about it now!
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
I know, man.
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
A parakeet?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Yeah, why?
Yeah and what would I say?
It was.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Hm.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Telling you what?
Smack?
Walter shut up and relax!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Uh, I don't know.
I thought you didn't respect money!
Really?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I was just straightening up the place.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Let's move out!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
You didn't like them.
Would you sleep with them?
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You were having a nightmare.
So I noticed.
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
You guys are thrashed.
Buffy.
Not exactly.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
A dress.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I should have known.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Why don't we see a movie?
Where?
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Get out of my facial.
Yeah, whoops I came.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
China.
Lothos.
I have to show you.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
Vampires of the world, beware.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Hi.
My parents have money...
I'm just a girl.
Could be.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Okay.
Right!
Like you've got a grip.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Nuke?!
You can't seduce me.
Yes I do...
I'm trying to play with your body!
I'll be back when we lose.
I won't be needing these anymore.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
So...Wanta make love?
Let me.
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Oh let's not...
Which one of us?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You spit on me!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Naw...
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Jesus.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Then go.
You fuck!
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
My right.
Forget it.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Can I give you my testimony?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
...and one helluva guy.
It's a damn convention.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
What are you talking about?
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Liar.
He's lying.
I was in the building!
Philip, if you would rise.
What do you propose?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Speeding?
Hello.
Right away.
Right back.
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
Hey.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Four aces, Doc.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
All right.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Hey, Rich.
Listen...
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Yeah?
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Meet me at three.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
Well...
How do you do?
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
What can I do?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Call security.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Right away. Okay?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
It's chinchilla.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Yeah, how do I know?
What? What?!
What's it...
Pretty serious.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
With what?
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!
I threw it away.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Who were you with?
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You fuckin' whore!
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
You're firin' me?
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Green?
Can you do it with your left hand?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
I can't.
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey!
Now move along.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
I'm over here now.
Oh.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Come on. Don't be scared.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
What's the matter?
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost?
Get lost?
Promise?
You do?
All right.
Two.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
No more! You see? Watch!
No, no, no, no!
You sure?
I'm sorry.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Then do it the way you want.
Having a good time?
I wonder..
You're probably right.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
I'm sure.
I lied.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Even the skylight?
I know.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I didn't hurt you.
You could've killed us.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Can you make him stop!
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
No -- nothing.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Sometimes I paint.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
That makes two of us.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Lucky for them they didn't.
Put the man back on.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
You're going to let them get away with this?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Stop talking like that!
The money, Nels ... ?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Why are we stopping?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
You're the man with the gun.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
I don't want it.
Keep talking.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
I thought you'd know me by now.
Take the 405 south.
How do you know?
In your dreams.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Who are you?
There's no lady here.
Hold on.
Let her tell you.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Undercover.
From here on, I dish it out.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Did I?
It's Dave.
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Guy I work with.
No.
Must be.
Like what?
Must be.
Yes, please.
How different?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
I am.
What is this?
All the time.
Dil --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Shut up.
I said stop it.
I know that.
You can always pretend.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Why, honey --
Not here.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
No.
I promise.
Sorry. What you doing?
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Prescription. For my condition.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Jimmy?
You knew my Jody?
Okay.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go, Dil
Got to be somewhere.
Never.
Fergus.
Tell me what she wore.
The Metro.
I know.
Suits you.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
And what happens then?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
How is it a farce?
My pleasure.
Can't we take it off?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
What?
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
The fastest.
I'll bear that in mind.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Shut up, would you?
Having a pint in the Rock.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
I told you not to talk that way --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What does that mean?
No.
Hurling --
Hurling --
You didn't?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
That's right.
How do you think I got here?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Why?
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
I love you, Adam.
I'm through listening to you!
Here, give it to me.
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
So that was it.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Because they're still here.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
But no one actually saw him die.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Very good.
Brian.
Yes.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Me?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
It's all right with us --
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Which one are you?
Come here.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay.
You did.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Maybe.
Maybe.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
Shut the door!
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm afraid it is important.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
Meaning what?
What do you want?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Swiss.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
What should we give him?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Where?
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
What?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Ça alors! From Charles?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
How can you tell?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Who invited you?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
As fucking if.
Not my imports.
I get the imports.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Calm down Brent.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You are upset.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
She works at a church?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You know about that too?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Who?
I was desperate. It was gross.
What?
Ok.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Stag?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I'll think about it.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Hi princess.
Yeah. Who is she?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
Who were they?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
The principal?
Who was the fourth?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Just thinking about something.
They're tasty.
Ok.
Told you to hide it.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
...-ty.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.

...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
 No.
Peace.

No.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
That dog was mean before I met him.
What the hell's goin' on?
You'd better coast through...
I did not steal this truck!
You're nuts, goin' back there!
...we can make it.

Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Come on!

 ...shit!

Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.
...yeah.
I'm crazy?
Then stay...
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
What?
Oh, shit.
What?
...-tion?
You know what I'm sayin'?
So I took his truck, yeah.
You know.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Hey.   Mason.
You all right?

What?
 Come on!


Sometimes the prey bites back.
...they come!
...our ass!
...here comes the...


We got-...
Hold this. 



Hello.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Oh, oh!
Yeah.
Yeah.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...about him.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Oh, my God.
Well, well, well.
And it won't be pleasant. 
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Hey!
I did what I could for you...
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

What the hell's a sage?
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...including the permanently extreme.

The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Is this stool taken?
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Went away? 
Almost quaint.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...here!
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Check it out.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...general store.
 But...
Where's their protective...
It's a hundred degrees...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I don't know what the hell...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.



Goddamn it, Ma-...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
...he's smart enough to get you...
There's something else too.
...now!
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
All right, let's move...
Get ready to take it out!
...son.
After that re-...
Uh-huh.
...colonel?
Who's your suspect?
...try this one out some-...
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
Doc!
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What?
...tunnel!
Yeah.
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Got that?
...seriously.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
That's right.
A ruler?
Who's the investigating officer?
Where from?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
When was the last time?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
She's fine.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Just bring your checkbook.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core club.
How are you, Lou?
Who?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
What for?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
A private investigator?
What are you having?
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
What do you mean?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Well, how much would you like?
But he wasn't killed.
Where you were when your husband died.
No reason.
Oh.
What? What is it?
Doing what?
Yeah.
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Including the death of your husband?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you saying?
I have to go home and get my things.
With us.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
When did you come in?
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I cut myself shaving.
Only when I breathe.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Si.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
Since lunch.
He was expecting you?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He owned it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Toto, come here.
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Progress! It always arrives too late!
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
I know.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Who said anything about brooms?
Yes.
Yes.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Ask them to sit down.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Emily -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
You really don't know who I am?
Well, I -
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Susan, I really think -
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
Thanks.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
I'll get you some coffee.
Why, Brad?
I know you will.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
He married you, didn't he?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Rosebud?
What the hell is that?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
No, this is great.
There's no light back there.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
But you were.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
Who doesn't?
Like what?
Was it you?
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Nobody. It was closed.
Yes.
Are you open?
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Why?
That girl was vile to you.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
What about Veronica?
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Each egg has to be perfect.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
All of them.
Can you believe this?!
FUCK!
I'm going to miss the game.
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
Gatorade.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Yeah, right.
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
Twenty-two; same as us.
I swear.
You want to rent a movie.
If you must.
Exactly.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Five hundred dollars.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Because I'm here.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
I was born.
What are you talking about?
Oh, like your life's any better?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave me alone.
Thanks.
Jesus.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
Helluva day.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I'm not dealing.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Maybe.
Actually, that's his night job.
So I'm told.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
I touched a nerve.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Including you?
You!
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Um. Thirty-seven.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Sure.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Veronica, I love you...
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
WHAT?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Yeah!
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
You're not?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks.
What usually eats a banana?
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Hi, Gabe.
Is it really four thousand?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Sure you can.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Just hangin' out.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
We spent a night there one night...
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
What are you doing here!?
You got to go back now!
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Excuse me?
Call me sentimental.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Never
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
I burned it.
What the hell's going on?
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
There.  You blind?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Ask the questions.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
And you, sir?
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Keeping fit then?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
You wanna be sick?
Murder, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Lice?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Indeed.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
I think...
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
I don't know...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Not our call, Phil.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Try?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I was just tryin' to...to...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I'm cool.
With what?
The trunk?
I don't think I can do this.
Yeah.
It's not me.
I tried it.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Tonight it is.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
You'd do her a favor.
What happened?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Doesn't cover everything.
I don't get it.
Why?
Makes two of us.
Some living.
What's at Union Station?
Let her go.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Shut the hell up.
Motive?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Nothing is easy.
Six months.  Eleven days.
Do they have a secret handshake?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Surprise me.
Can you prove any of this?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Not this again.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
They're big details, Jerry.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
This way.
Where are we going, Jerry?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill him?
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
You do?
Now she tells me.
Could you be a little more specific?
I'm not sure what you mean.
Well, I don't know if --
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Yes, that's right.
Working.
Agent Lowry?
This doesn't make sense.
No.  Not yet.
Yeah, I do.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I don't think so.
Ellie?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
With me.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Put it on speakers.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Because I can't.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
If you came back.
Really.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
-- I don't know --
I can't hear this now --
It was quite a page turner.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
But --
Cut that backsass!
We work down in the ditch?
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Yeah.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I don't know, Boss.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Borrowin'.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That fool. That damn fool.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Cuter.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
Andy?
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
When was that?
You already made the delivery?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
If he's not out, why are they here?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
How do you know that?
How did you know they were stockings?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
I know, baby.  I know.
What else?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Oh, I know.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Just horseshit luck.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
My promise.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Because I think I'm wrong.
Or the F.B.I.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
You're not envious?
It does.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I'd like to go back. James...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
No.
I can drive.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
That's thanks to all your help.
I ruined your wedding night.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
You too, Mom.
When did you start smoking?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Lie?
I guess so. I think that's right.
No.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
So are you engaged, or what?
Lie down.
But I do.     I love you, too.
I better make a list.
Open up.    I want to see.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Yeah?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Sure. Of course.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It doesn't matter who.
Here's the ring.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I heard about your friend.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Do you know who this is?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
What?   This?
It's me...
It's Daniel.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I guess we're going to find out.
I know they won't be home tonight.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
No problem.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
We'll think of something.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Do I?
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
No?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
You better.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Hard to say.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Relax. It will be fine.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.

No.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
They sort of got away.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Yeah, I dig him.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Watch this.
Oh, you think?
What?
I don't know.
Thanks.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Something like that.
You ask a lot of questions.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
A car.
It's for you.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then leave her to me.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I owe you nothing.
Don't bother.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're probably right.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Kneel!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
I will.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I should be trying to stop you.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
I dabble.  May I?
I think he's yours, now.
I went to see a friend of mine.
I don't know you...
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Shelly?
Go away.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
"Our" Crow...?
The night is young.
Excuse me?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You did?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Thank you.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Why not?
Give it up.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Without question.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
How was your date?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do not.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Not at all. Have a seat.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Why are you doing this?
Where are you going?
Get off me.
Yeah, me neither.
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Schwarz. Jewish?
Where did you say she's from?
I don't think that bothered him.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
I don't know.
Okay.
Well... not exactly.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Honey, is something wrong?
Who told you?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby?  Right on time.
I told you to lock the door.
And you think she bought it?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'll be in touch.
No.
Ronald?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Sounds intriguing.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
What's your plan of attack?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
Cecile.
Yeah.
Morning.
With who?
She shot you down.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
It was... Fantastic.
I've never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
Will you calm down?
I think you have your answer.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Yes, you already did.
What are you talking about?
I'd love to.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
What do you mean?
Oh, lots of times.
On the back street — a green house
Do you know the people?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Irena.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Yes, darling,
Well, it seemed to me --
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, daddy.
But wishes don't come true.
It was on account of the birthday party.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
Daddy, it's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
No.
You called me by my name.
I can not tell you.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Whenever you want.
Your children?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
That's the clever way to do it.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
Who is she?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Don't you hear it?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Good night...Barbara...
That's from her -- that woman.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Never felt better.
What else is there?
It's not just in my head.
What does that have to do with me?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Maybe he's just shy.
You're just saying that.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
I don't know.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
No. I don't think so.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
My vision got worse again.
No you don't, believe me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Did you get rid of Mark?
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
So you're Grant's secretary?
I'm not really hungry after all.
They say sex is great for cramps.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Yes I do have to pee!
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
On your desk.
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Very well then. Is that all?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Intriguing?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Briefs.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, my bite's a lot worse.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
What? Is there someone else?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Thanks.
We didn't have sex.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Packages of money.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
And he was missing an arm.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
This one walk you home too?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
The other one?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.  This way.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
I see...
How could you have been so stupid?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Why, yes.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Why are they after you?
Don't know much, do you?
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Yes.
I'm nothing then.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
No, it's the truth.
That's easy.  You...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Don't worry.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
Well it's a last minute change.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Fine...
Fine.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Exactly. A condition.
I was a senator, you know.
Is that everybody?
What about her.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
I'm going to kill him.
Bob...
Just what you think I mean.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Extend things?
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
I see what you mean.
We vetoed that?
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Wrong...
Does it make the cars any better?
I can't say.
I had a feeling.
Thanks, Duane.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I don't mind.
It's just so strange...
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
It's nice.
We're working on it.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Come on.
Quiet!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
We got a boat.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Don't come.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Well?
Garden?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm in.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
It does?  What?
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
No.
But, Chris...
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
My Word
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
A madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
I don't know.
I'm calling her!
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
What is it?
My brother went here.
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Yes.  But
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
Quiet.  I have to think.
what?
I will be with thee straight.
No thanks.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yes.
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Which question is that?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
How soon can we get up and running?
I told you...
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
You people...rich people...
Quite a few.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
You should talk...
I don't take orders at all.
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
I'm stuck...
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
She fucked me.
Damn right!
What?
It is too! Now you passed it!
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
It's Nick!
Yeah.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Married?
You mean...?
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
But I insist.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Thanks.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Inside, Vince.
Nick, she won't say why.
Linda, Linda...!
Sure.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
What?
Merle, I wanna go home!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Huh?
Yeah.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Then lemme have 'em.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
That's my plan.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What?
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Here. Behind you.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Your mother.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Remember my promise.
He could be brought back.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Go in the house.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Good night.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
No, sir.
What else did he get?
How ya feeling?
We're partners, aren't we?
I'm here.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
Take a look at this.
My granddad was a policeman.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I didn't.
And serve him right!
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
I did not, Grandma.
Howdy, Hank.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
-- of what happens after we die!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Never!
Ten throws it is.
Not long -- now.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You want me to go around --
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Not all of it?
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
Isn't that your own fault?
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
I say -- it don't matter.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
It's all right, Sheriff.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Of course not --
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Hullooo!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I object.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
That is Christmas music.
I'll find someplace.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
What does he want?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm a cop from New York.
Put it down now.
I'm going to count to three...
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Oh...Where does he live?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Two?  Are you sure?
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
You don't want to know.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Yessir.
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Come on, what's under this?
What about the kids?
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Jackie - what are you talking about?
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Hello, Sonny.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Why you going to Algeria?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I like that... yeah!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Well, then...
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
He's all doped up.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
It's all we got.
Mulvaney...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
I don't fool around with you.
What now, Sonny?
Howard!
No, that's all.
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Fuck him - let him out!
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
All right ... send them the guard.
What kind of a deal?
Yeah ...
Everybody!  Back here!
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
I'm here.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
No!
Doing what?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
PROVE IT!
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.

I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
My brother.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
And?
You a troublemaker?
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
We're still standing.
That's it?
How old are you?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
What responsibilities?
What are you so worked up about?
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
And move to Long Island...
C Duracell.
Fuck!  My money!
Don't worry about it.
That's my name.
What?
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Tonight, when we close.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Where we goin'?
Sal, I want my money.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
When?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Your memory is really getting bad.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Later.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
You're still late.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
What?
Ya like him, huh?
I was going to buy a slice.
I understand.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I like Mookie a lot.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Tell Vito.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
HARRY Dunne.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Coming.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I know I am, Mom.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Home school. Til today.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
You brave soldier.
Exactly! A pirate!
Will not.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
And my mouph is frozen.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Sucks for you.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
You can't marry my mom.
Shut up!
I bet you want your head scratched.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Do you know what this means?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Try one in a million!
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Looks like the best man won.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Will that be on the midterm?
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
And...?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Everything. Just for the record.
Just like the President.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
With your permission...
Nothing.
We felt his presence.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
They said you were dead.  They said...
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
You feel the flesh crisping?
What is it?
Where?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Do you want me to get it for you?
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Goulash.
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Mmph?  Where am I?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Eddie, you screwed up.
Don't let me slow you down.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
This is kind of a stream--
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
I thought he was dead.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Does she have room for me?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
I understand you just moved here?
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
What other sixty-thousand?
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
You could say that --
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Maybe it needs special handling.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh.  My condolences.
This is my thirteenth pair.
I am.  How's your father?
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Huh?
Bela died.
Uh, atomic energy?
The sun.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
You don't wanna be noticed?
Lines around the block.
Yeah...?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
NOOOOO!!!
No! Do they show you having sex?
At what point?
Yeah. Ma...
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
No.
Al!
Al!!
Went --
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Really? They were..
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
He made a mistake.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Holy sh--
What's the matter?!
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
No.
She left.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
You batted or you bunted?
Dynamite.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
That's lucky.
Why?
What?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
What?
What did you do to your hair?
It's nice.
What are you drunk?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Screw off.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No. What happened?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah.
I know.
Me?!
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Who's Shari?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
That's the point -- this could change things.
pierde.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Dick... Dick,..
So nice
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Why are you lecturing me?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Yes?
Would you sign it for me?
You'll be fine.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I have proof.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
What do you mean?
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
Larry, you just take it easy
What do you mean?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
What's it to you?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
It's not what you think.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Homicide?  A detective?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
I got to write my report first.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah.  A great big one.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
More.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Until he gunned down six people.
Believed what?
Man, what're you saying?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Gone.  Not a trace.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
I'll break them, sir.
Why?
And now you'll provide them.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
What's this all about, lad?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
Just don't shoot me.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Why not?
Under the house.
Is she?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Yeah, it's subtle.
What's he doing here, Sid?
And Reynolds?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I just called it.
Please hold, Sergeant...
Yes.
I'm telling you, I--
Turn on CNN.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Rachel Banks?
A direct one.
Told by whom?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Who was that other guy?
Who are they?
Yeah.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
One-twenty.
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Where?
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
Oh my God...
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
We're not gonna hurt you.
No he won't.
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
How fast can you learn?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Are you sure about this?
Thanks.
Okay.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No.
No, sir.
Yes sir.
Just for the criminals.
Right.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
Robert--
It's not real...  That's not me.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Well...yeah.
Stacy--
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Brill.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Why?
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I'm sorry about that.
We believe he did.
We'd rather not--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Merry Christmas, son.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Hi, dad.
Can I open 'em up?
Alright!
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Why would they--
Why would the NSA--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Jerry?
How can I reach you?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
You would?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
What the hell does it mean?
I said fuck you.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He's clever. He had help.
Dean's with Lyle.
What about the tape?
What's your ETA?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Her or me?
Pardon?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Oh my God, the others!
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Good.
You don't sew at all!
That makes it harder still.
Now.
Now.
This is empty, just coming!
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
What?
Would you let me pass?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
Don't talk.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
What?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Right.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Thank you.
I don't know.
Are you Hana?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Ask him.
She can take you as far as Florence.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Are you planning to be the exception?
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
What?
Me?
I see.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
Aren't you?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
Are you crazy?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Yes?
Your friend?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Hey! -
Would you like me to?
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Thank you.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
He's sleeping.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Why not?
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Bingo.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
We're getting close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Then don't.
I sincerely hope so.
You...you can't.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can't.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Not a word.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
I'm not the one to ask...
Certainly not mine. Come on.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Our equipment has arrived.
It was a long time ago.
Charged?
One more item--not on the check list.
I've got something for you.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Got it.
Duh.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Right. The eight billion.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Feeling old?
Call it a new tradition.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
They drive so recklessly there.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
No, you can't.
You gave them the eight billion.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
This is big enough.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You know where my loyalties lie.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Who?
Which one?
You're a lawyer?
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Don't bother.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Erin --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<u>No</u>.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
They skipped that step.
No shit.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
How do you know that?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Not anymore.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
I'm gonna go live with George.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I'm just saying --
How would you know?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
Mm-hm.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
That's okay.  I understand.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Next week.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
I can help them!
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Okay, okay.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Howls.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
You know the Jedi Master?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
And what are they, pray tell?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Now you're making sense.
What is it?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Who's staring?
You look great.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Hyperdrive.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
I understand.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I thought I was in good shape.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That is why you fail.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
Never.
I want that ship.
He's a gorilla.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Where?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Lock fuel rods.
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Don't like it, don't come.
If he lets you get close enough.
Who?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Sewers. Come on.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Move aside!
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
...of course...
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
...to ride out and meet them.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Rise, Mordred.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
No.
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
He has given up.
Can it truly be used for magic?
I'm not jealous!
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
I?
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hi, how'd your day go?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Why don't you let me?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
I can't believe it.
We still don't know.
No. Not at all,
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
I just heard them Karl.
Karl!!
What!
What man?
No thanks Karl.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
You could do it yourself...
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
What else?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Are you sure?
Father?
When can I have one?
Yeah.
Cause I like it.
I wouldn't talk.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
What?
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
St. Mike's.
Okay.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Sure.
You might loosen the straps then.
Intensely.
Uh Huh.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Uoy era ohw.
Uoy era ohw.
How's your leg?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
But deliver us from the evil one.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Defender of the human race...
She'll go into coma.
From the psychiatric end.
Unlikely.
Sick priest, is that it?
That's to bad.
Are you tired?
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes?
Sometimes.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Teeth.
They're falling out.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Two at a time?
Recognize these two characters?
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
Am I late?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Huh?
I hate your kids, Frank.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
Yeah, okay.
Terrific.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Let's get it over with.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
It's early.
She'll get here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
First night?
Last?
A few bars!
Okay.
Right.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
You're making things up, Frank.
I can't make the tenth.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Later.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
This'll kill 'em.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Yeah.
She asked for it.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
My watch is broken, too.
Impersonally.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's my name?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Piece of cake.
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
Yeah.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
They must've bought the same map we did.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Gotta go.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
He leads, I follow.
Not for money. With my mother.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
You want me to walk you?
Every year.
In and out.
Who's Nina?
Sure.
Must've been a cheap date.
Oh.
Coffee?
So how's the cat food business?
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Losing his teeth.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
My place.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
Something good?
So you had a nightmare.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Don't hang up ...
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Would it?
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Not anymore.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Not if I kill you first ...
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Get rid of them.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Have fun at work.
-- I've got to study.
Gone?
Great.
Oh, that Karl.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What about me?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
That’s where you work.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Hey...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Uh huh...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Okay, chief.
What?
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
...my feet are hurtin’...
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
You had a heart attack?
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
It’s good, right?
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
Zeena...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Are you okay, Jack?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Jesus, Jack...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Hey, are you okay?
I’m sorry, no...
I'd like that, too.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
You'd never know it.
He's made a few changes.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
That's terrible news...
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Sure.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
It's been changed.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Passion.
Are you kidding?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Why didn't you say something?
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
Here's the Surgeon.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We must!
Yes, Cora.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
You may learn to like it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
The Breath of God...
No, there's no other way.
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Well, we better get on with it.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Send the following message...
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
I could use a lawnmower...
What's this, sir?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't think so. It's nice.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
I did.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Whoa, Daddy.
Jezhush.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Oh, geez.
...The heck d'ya mean?
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
End a April.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Mr. Mohra?
Oh sure.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh.
Chaska.
Can you be any more specific?
Yeah!
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah!
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
...Brainerd?
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
No, no, fax is -
Good day, sir.
Okay.
...Who they playin'?
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
The heck d'ya mean?
Mm.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Yah.
Yah...
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
His wife?
No.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
We've got a -
Yah?
They're real good.
No, no.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah.
Where's Tyler?
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really, what's that?
Oh.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
Have you finished those reports?
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
No, I wasn't aware...
Does this sound strange to you?
What does that mean?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Really?
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
So you're staying in tonight?
I could check your prostate.
Whatever.
... A person.
Can I come in?
What?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
What... ?
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
What?
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Who's this?
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Okay, everyone.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Being clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
And, now it's gone.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
A hotel?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
This is crazy.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Doesn't matter.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Don't mention me.
No, I'm not...
What should I have told you?
Look...
What are you doing?!
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I don't know!  Tell me!
And, sometimes you control it...
This isn't possible...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
I'm going to...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
If you know, I know.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What have you left for me?
Maintenance.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Well, sir, you said you might.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Pleeeeeease!
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
I hope you're ready for this.
You were there?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Taken care of.
Carter.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Maybe.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like what?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I know how it feels to be dead.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I...I don't know.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
As in flannels and plaids?
Like... 4:25.
Let us out!
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
That's a plan.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Design?
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That's right, buddy.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There's a compass in the handle.
There are no worse places.
I need a vacation.
Let me see.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
I thought he was with you.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
You think you are... .
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Not yet.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Am I out of here?
I say we tape him to a chair.
You threw him out?
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
No, I'm fine... really...
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You can ask.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
How much?
Sshhhh!
God... I'm the janitor of God.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You really want to help me?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
The Red Knight!
It's a classic.
I know!
You won't be alone for long.
I don't like horror movies!
What a gyp.
It sounds exciting.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Divorced.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You said.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Do you love me, Bobby?
I love it.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Who?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Am I on TV?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Yeah, me, too...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What?
Why are you being so mean?
Yeah, well, he's...
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Thank you.
I think it's what you think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
That's right.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Catherine...
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
That's what I mean...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Steam.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Look at me.
Wussup.
No.  What you do today?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Of course.
You got a boyfriend?
You look good.
I kissed those girls.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
C'mon.
For real?
You gonna talk to him?
She didn't say she had no man.
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Yeah.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Nineteen.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Thank God, the police.
Yes.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
There is?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
Gum thought Brazil.
I'm fine.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Velma.
Oh, about ten days ago.
No problem.
Fletch?
What?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Yeah. Maybe.
Why not?
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Sure, all drifters do.
Deal.
Don't say shoot, okay.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
You are a rich woman.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
I ordered lunch.
I saved his life during the war.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Come here.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
What?
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I don't know.  Look!
Why not? Oh shit... really?
You broke it? You know the source?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Utah?
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Frieda's boss.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
But I am...
Thanks, I needed that.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Great pipes.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
You're not funny.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Ye-ah.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Twelve pack?
Did he just say what I think he said?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
And hey, I appreciate it...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
I'm off it!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Are you okay?
Ciao.
That's funny, you're cute.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Boca?
Doesn't register.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Fake it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
What's he do?
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Third time around.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Darling, may I have this one?
Why is it called Hellgate?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Well, I think you do.
What I know is what I told you.
Yeah.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Baltimore?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Frank, this is insane...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
I can't believe people are still using these things.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
Yeah...I think so.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I never knew you, Dad.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I don't understand.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Something happened, something...
October 22, 1969.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Yeah, I think so...
In my pocket.
Dad, you there?
Sully!  Is that you?
Longbranch...?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You work too hard, John.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
No.  What house you work?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
Yes, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Hello.  How are you?
Are you all right, Shelly?
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Maybe.
Don't say any more.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
We're gonna scare him?!
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I wish it was.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
'Cause it stinks.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Boy scouting.
Yeah, we're here.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I'm here.
Okay, I'll call you later.
I'm now begging you.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Yeah...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
-- Bad?!
She did!
Never.
I mean really never.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
What are you going to do?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
We have to get off this ship!!
Nothing.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I...I can't...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I'd love to.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Where are they?
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Please, hurry...
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
That's where I peed.
Alla puttanesca.
Press a button and they give us money.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Unbelievable.
You know about Adele.
Can he get through it?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
About what?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
We don't even like each other, do we?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
A flat-out hit.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
How prominent?
That's very lovely actually.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Washed away.
Life is real.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Oh yeah?
That's a simple subject.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I was educated by nuns.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Is what true?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Well, we shall try.
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
You will respect the law.
A great deal.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I --
No.
It's split the Government.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Thank you. No.
I dined at the prison.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Somehow I expected not.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Who's leading them?
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Blood.  From the vein.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where do we start?
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Again?
What's wrong with him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Not bad, Jerome.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
How tall are you?
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Why would we do that?
Friend?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
Of course.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I'm not doing it.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Hi.
Yeah.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Sure.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I mean it.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Twenty eight hundred.
No scars.
Sure...
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Whatever happens it's over.
I'll be ready.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Okay. How many bank exits?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
What's it to you?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Just... tell us what you want.
Can he trust you?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I know.
When did you find out?
Who?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Christ, what...
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Yes, I do.
Go on.
Really?
No. I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Expect so.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Nice of you to come.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
Yeah.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Right.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
You sure?
My brother, Frank.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Don't ask me.
What about Keith?
What's that supposed to mean?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Not much.
What you doing around here then?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Still got your sense of humour.
Piss off, Ray.
Knock it off, Gerald.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
That's right.
I had to.
To get on the...
They came in and they, you know...
Eh...?
...cower in his boots...
Yes.
That's right...
Huh.
You...
What?
What?
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Talking about it as a...
That's right.
What will he pay?
What?
Why would they come to me?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
Yes.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
What?
To the cops?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
You understand?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Excuse me...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Would you excuse us, please.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
...after the thirtieth...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Either way.  You're out.
I can't do it, Shel.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Now.  Yes...When?
I can't split them.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Uh-huh?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Only the beginning...
You sold eight Mountain View?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Home cooking...
Oh!  For the magazine...
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Mmmm...
Lingk.  James Lingk.
My wife...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
I'm not.
If we wait till Mon...
Tell me again.  Your wife.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
It's nothing.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
You did that?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Did they...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Just a few days.
I can't.
To do business.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I'm not hungry.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
Connie.
I saw him with you.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Tom is right.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We're making an investment in Havana.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was hard to have him killed.
What's that?
It's the way Pop wanted it.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
What?
 And he agreed?
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Sure, Mikey.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
It was a boy.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Did my brother go back?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Michael.
Right here.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
No, I'm fine.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
I do not.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
No, she's here.
What about Michael Corleone?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Weird.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn't mean to...
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Well...no, not really --
What do I do?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
What did she mean by going flooey?
Huh?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
It's new.
Did anyone laugh?
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
I don't like to talk about that.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Can't today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
You don't think of me that way, do you?
No.  I --
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Do you miss it?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Not me.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
You're talking through your hat now.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Clayton is fine.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Do I have any other choice?
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
All right.
Fuck off!
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Thank you.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
So what do I do?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Yes?
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Who do you think?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
How is he?
How's Atley -- ?
A little family emergency --
Something like that -
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Double-meaning intended --
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny-nothin'!
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
How you doing, man?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
And there she is --
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
We don't -- ?
You, too, Ma...
How's Kip?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What do you say, Toby?,
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Don't go there, Toby --
Yeah -
Something like that -
Me...
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
What?
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
That what you want?
No. Open her ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
She left...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Billy, how are you?
What?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I understand.
You treated me like shit.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
How much?
That again.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
Shit.
What are you talking about?
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Just get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
You what?
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
There are cops all over the place.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Tommy  ...
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
That's important.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
But, Paulie, please.
Please?
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Stop crowdin the plate!
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
She went to Medical school in California.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
It's touching me.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
--But--
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Really?
What're those?
That's right.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Good to see you.
I've been busy.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Like what, Will?
What places?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
How about the ones on that shelf?
You think so?
Nautilus?
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Fine.
Haven't called her.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Yeah.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't want the job.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
You're not going to fail me are you?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
You're Welcome, Will.
I kind of got that impression.
Okay, sounds good.
What?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Do you know all their names?
Do you keep in touch with them?
No.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess so.
Like me?
No.
I'm not honest?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
Joe!
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Now I can't breathe.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Four.
Two.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
You got dances too?
Say, who runs this place?
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
Thought you was in jail.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Can't you see that sticker?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
That's where I get off.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Hush!
Didn' you have no breakfast?
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
No'm.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I'm ready.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
No.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Then what, Tom?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Me an' you both.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Whatsa matter?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Really?
What do you want to do?
Insane.
Yep.
Unbelievable.
Okay... Hold on...
We haven't seen each other since high school.
You're a government spook?
Jesus Christ!
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Come on.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Mmm.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
What stuff?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Excellent. Here they come.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
I don't think so.
All of it?
Never enough.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
You too.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What's that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You sleeping all right in that house?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
Huh?
I don't care! We'd be together.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
The point was to love each other.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Hi.
Well, one was for salad...
You're right. Good.
About what?
Tom?
Well, now you know what it feels like.
I said... I started.
What?... Oh baby...
That's not true.
Go ahead...
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Doing what?
Yeah.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
About what?
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
What do you mean?
Oh, I don't know...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I'd love to go there one time...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Oh, how sweet.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
What?
Diane!
That's what some folks say.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I don't know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
Oh yeah...
Now that's cool.
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Alright sir.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Super hero like even.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Go fix the phones.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Mm-hmm.
Hmmm.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Razor and Blade.
Burn!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
If I win, you become my slave.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
You would have looked better.
Dreams?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Gill.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
Cancer?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Hey, it's me.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
No, you don't understand.
What does that mean?
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Go!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
It's okay..it's okay.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
How do you know their not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Got it Ben.
Evil.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Come with me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Sure.
Sure.
I don't like that story.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
What does that mean?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
And then, uh, April...huh?
Oh, is that what it is?
Yeah.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
And it ruins everything else.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Let's take a look.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Oh, great.
You're out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Yes, I do.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
No?
Yes?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
No, I don't think so.
Well, sure.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Oh, right.
Did you ever read this one--?
I have been in love with you for so long.
Oh, don't say those words!
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I almost didn't.
I know it isn't.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Are you in love with someone else?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Stop accusing me!
I'm sorry.
Oh...
You know... 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
Really?
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I think we need to eat.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think so.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
That's a beauty!
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
No, no, we decided!
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Uh-oh.
You know.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Well-well, like what?
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
How?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I remember you.
Yeah.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh.  Oh.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Oh...
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Some museum director disappeared.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Or, perhaps...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Say it in English.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
What's up...?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Show me the Pigs.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
The children...?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
Mmm...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
Let the girl go.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I have had many excellent meals there.
...how so?
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Enchante.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Sir, with all due respect....
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
You're <u>free</u>...
...what has she done to harm you...?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
...not to turn around.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Then we cannot go.
...what did you want? 
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
Brazilian. 
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
...yes...?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
You guys have been so colossal...
You're all making me blush...
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
That wants to be a Yes.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
Iunno.
Don't worry, you...
It's not my style, okay?
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
You goddamn bitch!
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No.
Suicide is a private thing.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
You must have had fun.
Of course.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
What?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Superb.
Sure. Ciao.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
frowns at Henry.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
sighs.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Open this door!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
Saint Mario!
He . . .
This . . .
God, yes!
What??
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Second most common?
You just made that up.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What's that?
Uh... eighty two?
But... I thought...
This isn't happening.
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
No please make yourself at home.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Thanks.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't work here.
Who the hell are you talking to?
What things do you think you've done?
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
It's November.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Mister LaPlante...
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Me!
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
What picture?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Bodybuilding!
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Unprofessional.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
She's talking to him now.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Okay.
Well, it's for a woman.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I understand that.
Who doesn't?
Just show me the way.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
It's a living.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Uh huh.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
I'm thirsty.
A man scared me.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
That's okay, Mom.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Fuck you, Philip.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
He wasn't there.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Do you have enough money?
I didn't.
The thermometer's broken.
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Even cosier.
Would you?
Really.
Not now.  I'm busy.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Around.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
That is what bothers me.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
She's the King's cousin.
No.  What am I to do?
It's done.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why not?
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
What are you hoping to find inside?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
Then how did he know your name?
I'm interested in mythology.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
I wanted to get to know you better.
No.
So?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
You?
It will end tonight.
He will not stop until it is over.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
What?  How?
I like my work.
No.
I don't know.
Yes.
Fine.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
I think he's dead!
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
I'm going to my desk.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Dennis.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
Where is it?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Shh, they'll hear you!
How about dog shit?
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Go, Chief.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Order your men to stand down.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
What?
Not until the man calls.
Where's the office?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
In my room.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I guess we do.
We, who is we?
Of course.
Let me see your identity card.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
And what will they do with these satellites?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No, sir.
How so.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
At least.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
When will they be here?
Give me the phone.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
How do you know?
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
What?
Murdered! By whom?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Stay with the children.
It will do just fine.
Why?
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Why?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
When?
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
The staff, the guests.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Where?
What is his room number?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
I'm moved beyond words.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
C'mon.
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
The...Fourth of July.
Up here --
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Back where?
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Really? Well, let it rip.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- my loss --
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- no more --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
-- ten.
Suppose not.
Yes.  It was.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
I'm sorry.
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
I'm ok mommy.
Where is she now?
Take me to her.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Good night.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Runic?
What?
Well what is it!
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
I know what I saw.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
I don't know ...
What happened to him?
That's great.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
Would you know this store again?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
You're JP Monroe, right?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
You re not thinking of going to...
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Why not just go now?
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
Last rites, sister?
Ooh-kay...
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Never, why do you ask?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Trust Leonardo....
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
I don't care.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Alchemy.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
The Hipster!
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
He didn't offer you money.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
-- or lack thereof?
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
...Why don't I just type this up...
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Oh Norville, I --
Tell me about it.
Forty-eight years...
What the heck they doin'?
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Yeah, but, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
-- tough titty toenails!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
You --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Oh my God, sir!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Yeah, tell me about it.
Ya get the special?
The mark notices.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
He notices.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
Thank you for waking me.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Is she a doctor?
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
Did you hear what he sang?
But she's not dead, Wes.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
I often do.
I imagined this so differently...
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Yes.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Got a meeting uptown.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
That shirt?
You think I --
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Good.
Hnnn.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Nah.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
A key party?
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
With Mikey?
We were just riding around.
Mom. Are you ok?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Thanks for the advice dad.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Who said so?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Wendy!
Yeah.
Can I come?
Charles, what time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Hey Sandy.
I had him!
Too bad...
Don't worry about him...
We already did.
Yeah.  All over.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Worth pursuing?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
No.
First I need a copy of the key.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
You know what about.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
That's not what he thinks.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Huh?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
That's a long time.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Who?
What was it?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Then there is nothing.
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
If you say so. You are innocent.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
No.
I didn't realise.
It will grow back again!
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
What have you done?
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
He jests.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
Yes...
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Be still!
Yes...
What do you mean?
Yes...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Sure...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
You have fed. You were made for this...
And if I don't?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
How could I not? She had to know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
No...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Don't even think about it.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Just kidding.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
No, you're not.
Ray, we're just friend.
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
This weekend?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
It's gonna be great.
I don't know.
To get out of Southport?
What?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Hey --
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How's Julie?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
And do what with it?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
This was once a cemetery.
I donut understand.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
On my word! That's what they believe.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
I was looking for you.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
They shall not hurt you
My last name is Pherides.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Who?
All right –– all right.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
What did . . .
Yeah, very funny.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
No!
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
What's that book you've got there?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
The Building and what?
They went out of business years ago.
I know. I know.
All right.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
All in . . .
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm?
Oh, George!
Yes –– charge.
Aw, forget it.
Have a good time, son.
Very funny. Very funny.
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
How do you do.
They're not my children.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I'll take chocolate.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Come on, tell me.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Have you made up your mind?
Well, then, sit down.
To keep from being an old maid.
My baby.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
I've eaten.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
What?
Sure, sure I am.
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
I'm supposed to.
Good.  It's terrible.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
We're hung up on something.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
You're betting what you already got.
Sean!  Catch it!
You bet.  Hang on....
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Hey -- you can't do that.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Not till next year.
Hey, come on....
You don't make enough.
First things first.
The Shark's mouth.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Is there one in these waters?
Sound?
Can't you tell?
Fooling around?
Home it is.
What're you guys doing today?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
For me?
Damn.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Terrific.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Do you?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
What?
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
That's what he said.
What's daddy doing?
Now I really want to see it.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Great.
I will, I will.
Who'd you ask?
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
Just like this.
What Kids?  Who went out?
I'm going.
What the hell is it?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Sean, baby, please....
No.
Len, can I see you a minute?
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Yeah.  Down there.
No.
Hope I make it through both.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Yes.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Up.
I talked you into this?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
What's that?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No, you're not.
Me, too.
You don't.
Sure.  Let's go.
No,  I'm not going through there.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Well, then I'm going to film it.
So do I, love.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Still sleeping.
Thanks for helping.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Not good enough.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I don't know, it depends.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
What the hell's there?
Oh...
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's not closing, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Right, Mike.
Sharks???
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
I want to see Kathryn.
We're in love.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, I did.
He told me you both did....
He was doing his job....
Nowhere....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
No....
It went away....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Whatever happens next.....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
It's not nice to be evasive.
Thanks for the consultation....
I'll miss you....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I'm not going to quit now....
I am.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
No.
Promise me....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're not going to bet it all....
No!
I have my own little island.
What?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
She said it was coming....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
You didn't stick them on right....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Stop busting my hump....
Holy shit!
Down here....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What?
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Just trying to be helpful....
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Screw you, Jake....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
It'll work....
No way....
Here it comes....
When he has a pillow over his head....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Good night, Polly....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
The <u>dogs</u>?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Not too good in daylight ..
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I already did. What's his problem?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I was wrong.
You looked like you did?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
You don't really believe this?
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
No.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Maybe he's lying to you?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Have you known her long?
Which is what?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
No I'm not.
I can't identify him ..
I know about alcohol, John.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Ask him.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I know about the bachelor party.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
There is something missing here.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
No.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
I see what you're saying.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Absolutely.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
I just got goosebumps.
Thanks.
Hi.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Oh hell yes.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why do you love me?
Tell me -- let me help --
You want...
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
So this break... is a break-up.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Please, if I start talking --
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Ten seconds, Rod.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Huh?
I understand your anxiety.
Great word.  Towel?
No, I'm saying to be --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
How do I know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Fine.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
How sad --
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
You'll lose.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Hi Ray.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Yeah I know.  I did.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
One way to find out.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
I would completely support that.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Just hold on.
I thought you were an expert.
They're here.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
I don't think so.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
KEEP GOING!
NO!
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Something must've scared them.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
No.  I feel something.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Not without a shot of the nest.
Which one?
Come on!
Okay.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Possible.
Why?
What do you think they want?!
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
I have to find Kelly!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
I believe in him.
I'm trying!
Can the kid walk?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh!
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Look.
They died together?
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
We were right!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
I know.
Not just every six weeks.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
I don't know.
What's that?
Okay.
Stick to my heels.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
Please - - chance it.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Oh, yeah - - great.
Listen, ahh - -
Really?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Machines hate you?
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
I didn't say I was scared.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
I'll stay awake.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Yes.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Excellent.
Why did you do this?
They don't bother me.
What?
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Not yet.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
What was the matter with it?
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- In what sense?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.
Yes.
Another one?
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
And you ...?
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
-- Listen to me --
Eight -- and seven months.
I don't know.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
You look tired.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
It's ... lovely.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father ... Father!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Leave it, Ann.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
What?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Didn't want you.
So do I.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
-- Tuscarora --
I go on rounds.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Is that what you gave him?
No, I said what did you think.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Thanks.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I don't like getting splashed.
With Trina.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
They don't scare me any more.
I better keep looking.
Yeah.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
It's not so bad.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I wanted to give it to you first.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Then how are you involved?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Yeah.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Nobody's seen that.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Not particularly.
Lunch in a restaurant.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Soon.  Very soon.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Mom, I mean dad?
I guess...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
That's okay...
I hate it.
Yeah?
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
It's my name too.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Where will my toys be?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Yes, your honor.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Objection!
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Yes...
Yes.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
I...I don't know...
I suppose...
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Yes...How's Billy?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Kramer...
I'm going to take it.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Ted?  Are you there?
No, but--
Look, Ted, all I--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
What?
Uh, huh...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Ha!  You tell me.
Yes. I am ready.
Again?
No cried?
I know.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
Can I free the prisoners?
No!
General Chiang.
Soon.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
We did not.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
You could buy them.
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You will always!
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Is that true or pretend?
You cannot.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
We have.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
It is possible, Holiness.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Go ahead.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
And you like me.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
What the hell are you doing?!!
A spring trap!
No crocodile has ever--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Then do it!!
Get the gun.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
We both know what they'll do.
Right.
You do?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
So I don't like tents, why--
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Excuse me?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Ssssh!
You calm down!
You wouldn't?
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Other than to eat us?
I'll take it!
Did he say anything?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Is the dead guy in there?
Seconds.  Three, four.
You talk to the married couple?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I got nothing against--
It's just that--
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
Hector thinks you like him.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
What?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Wait.
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
I understand.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Starling -
Jack Gordon.
Thanks.
Yes sir.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Sewing...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Did you ever work with her?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Mmm. And what else...?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
How long did you live there?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Later, listen, I'll -
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Can we rest soon?
I'm sorry.
Sorry to disappoint you...
Miss.  May I?
No. I will find you.
...never doubt what you are doing.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
"Some"?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Fire!!!
Yes sir!
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
And this?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
He did.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Crunch...Implosion.
No.
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
It...almost got you.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What music?  There ain't no music.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Two hundred meters.
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
The air's stopped.
Your pocket?
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Can I help?
Yes?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Jesus Christ!
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Furry muff, let's go.
Just give me the keys.
OK, open the gate.
How about you? All right?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
You will what?
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Well, perhaps you can help?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
So?
Tom, you're all heart.
Nick the Greek.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How the fuck should I know?
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
Leave your sister out of it.
I can't take any more school.
They're not going to jail.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I do, sir.
No, sir. Not at all.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
We were just dancing--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Sergeant?
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He a Black man or an Indian?
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
You know who I am?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
He does.
Made some money, came back here--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
We should just do it.
Pleased to meet you.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That's where he fell.
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
That's right.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Why would you want to do that?
Aqui! [Here!]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We have a murder?
The Perdido thing?
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
That's me.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
How much you got left?
So I've heard--
Well, you were working there--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Yeah.
More, I hope.
Two years.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You don't need to cuff me.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
What's up?
No--
I know that.
They go together.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
It's him... it's him.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Yes.
Yes.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
Did your husband know Quaid?
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
Do you?
Sure.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
I told you --
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
You can't.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I just saw him.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
So could you walk on water?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Fuck you.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
I'm here to offer you a job.
You know of him?
Are you a believer, then?
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
A Mister Quaid?
Does anybody?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
What?
Well... nobody.
They'll never find out.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
You didn't try hard enough.
Yes?
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
What?
And he's dead?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Not true.
Yes.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
No way.
I know. I don't either.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
You're possessive.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
They really have to work on that street name thing.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yeah, look at that thing.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes, no.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
I don't think so.
Ok, well... I love you.
It's just carpet.
Alright?
Do you want I send it to your room?
One moment, please.
What?
Sure.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
What happened?
When did they find her?
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
My secretary?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Father, I'm right here.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
What's his name?
You just call?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What?
Maybe that's my problem.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Not a lot.
Whish the circumstances were different.
I know who he is.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I don't remember that.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Sort of.
What?
Why not?
Always on my ass, anyway.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Mom tell you to do this?
Yeah, right.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
What?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Just like that?
Lucky.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
Uh huh.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Kay.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Your legs don't look broke.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Figures.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
I know, right?
I said fine.
What are we playing for?
My court, I go first.
I wanted you to.
Quincy...
Not really.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I don't think so.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
What do you mean?
Why do you keep asking me that?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Hey.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Uh, your earring?
We were just studying.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
This is just about money, you know that.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
You know, people.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Your door was unlocked.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
What?
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
ooohhhhhh no.
In my sleep, Burt.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Well what's the situation?
Does this sound weird?
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
LAPD. Open the door.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
-- do you wanna cup?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
I don't have a boyfriend.
What's that stand for?
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Good bye.
Well...is that illegal?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
ok.
I'm sorry --
Can I tell you something?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
That was so great what you just said.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
You mind if I come in, check things?
Yes.
It's upstairs.
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
No.
I'm a rapper.
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
I was listening --
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Well --
You're a friend of the family I presume?
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Where is he?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
There's no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Who?
Twelve.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Is this 509-9027?
Alright.  Thank you.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
So boring, so useless --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
What am I doing?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Right.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
What name?  My name?
...are you Phil...?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
The door was open, I got a call --
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
And what about screaming?
What's this, how did this happen?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I got in trouble at school.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
Did you ever touch her?
...I don't know...
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Like what?
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Thank you.
Maybe.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Love you too.
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
I don't know.
It's ok.
Yes.
I have money.
This happens....this is something that happens.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Replace the king.
I am with you!
Soon enough.  Here we are.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted --
Yes, and he has a choice!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But -- what is he doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
You're a fool!
It is also a place of burial.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
He is right, d'Artagnan.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Whose rooms are those?
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Your Majesty has had many women --
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Get out of my way.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
I must insist, Sire.
Thank you, Keeper.
Yes, yes, go on.
You would do that, your Majesty?
Sire, I --
Yeah?
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
So what?
You mean shut your ass down!
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Who is it?
Yeah?
You're the mysterious type, right?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
I killed them.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Both at the same bank...
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
That was Peterson upstairs.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Book code?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
I have to.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Somebody hurt him?
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You said the guy down here is good.
What's one way?
See? You do know something about him.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Wait, Will...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
This is our boy...!
It'll do fine.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
It's a surprise.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Tooth...
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
I'm very scared.
Yes.
You'll let me go now?
I don't think I'll tell you.
That's true.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
He only bit women so far, right?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
I love you...
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Will...
I want to see you, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
Go on to the house.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Huh?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I thought you would have some ideas.
You had disadvantages.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Tank you veddy much.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
What's up?
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Twenty!
Deal.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I can shtop whenever I want...
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You don't know the real me.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
He said he's coming back!
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
Should Tank I.D. it?
I know.  It's her fault.
Two grand.
The Matrix isn't real!
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
What happened to them?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Are they any agent?
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
What do you know?
What truth?
Wild, isn't it?
Show me.
I think I do.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Shit, I'm sorry.
I'm not the One.
What do you mean, without him?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
Yes.
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Why?
I believe I can bring him back.
Yeah?
It wasn't fast enough.
Because I believe in something.
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
I can't!
Hurry, Neo.
Follow me.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
You sure?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok.  Wait here.
Can't we come with you?
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Kennedy.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
No you're not...
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Mind your own business.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
Forget it.
Ok, how's everything going?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
How much was the original loan again?
Fine.
I know.
Chinese food?
Oh...around...why?
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
A paper on that one too?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
He's coming.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Who?
Of course.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Here...
Cold.
"Death and Taxes"?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Me, too.
I am now.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Yeah.  Neat.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Hi, Jennifer.
Sure.
It's so very nice to see you again.
You're welcome.
What do you mean 'free'?
Peanut butter.
Do you love Drew?
Yes?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Not now.
I am, too.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
And you can't tell me who you are.
It's a saying.
-- Yes?
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
So can I.
Oh.  Okay.
Why didn't you stop me?
Just a manner of speaking.
Yeah.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Get him in here.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
You fill the bill, Bill.
What?
Watch it!
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Yes, I believe I do.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Hi, honey.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
I am.  With you.
Uh oh --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
You're not listening --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
It's something.
Joe?
I don't understand.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I could be her.
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
I think I know her.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
That's right I did, didn't I?
Don't say anything else.
You told me.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Can I ask you something?
Thank you.
What are you here for?
Who's your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Thank you.
You're in a playful mood.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Shut it, Teddy.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Why are you following me?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Somehow, I'll know!
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Lemon or lime?
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Doing...?
I was the kids' godfather.
"And" what?
He any good?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
It's a rip and a hit.
Tell them what you want.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Make it 35.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
You do.
Okay.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Havana.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
No.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
I'll be on board by noon.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Port-Au-Prince.
Five minutes...
No.
On my way back...
Okay.  What's up?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
To recruit you.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Where's Riccardo?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Goodbye.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
He did volunteer one time...
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
I had to lay eyes on you.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Alonzo...
They lied.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
You like it? Take a look.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
What?
Get outta my way.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Ready for anything.
Get down -- where?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
We go through the wall?
What?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
For the money... )
Sixty?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Would you recognize him again?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
About as good as it looks.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
Thank you.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
What?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Shit.
New York's finest.
H-how do I get...?
No, you talkin' at me.
Oh, man, there you go again.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Depends.  You got a memo?
The kid's with them!!
Go!! Just go!!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
Please.
Maybe they lied to you.
So?
You the bug lady, right?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
--my number one fan.
What are they...?
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
If you wouldn't mind.
It's fine.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I can live with "great."
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
I DIDN'T...
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
Great.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
C'mere, I'll show you.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pills NOW!
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I'm telling you, I can't.
I said that?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I'm almost done.
What?
What is it?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Buster.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
That'd be a first.
Great.
All done, chief..
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
To do what?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
What are you talking about?
Not for seven more minutes.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
What if I pay the rent?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
They've got a book for everything.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
You mean it'll be difficult.
She sacrificed herself..
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
By asking me.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
They'll kill me.
What about him...?
All ten million.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Take off your coat.
Who is "they?"
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Sure...
You don't think we're going to make it.
You didn't have to.........
Is this the only way?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Profitable.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
That depends.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
He's our guy.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
I don't know.
Jack you're so wicked.
No, I'm going.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Thank you, Rose.
I'm going to bed now.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Bed.
Ti amo.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Maybe.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Good morning, Lucy.
Excuse me.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Instantaneous.
Stupid.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You really are stupid, you know that.
I was dead, too.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Take it easy.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
You ruined my life.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
It's the best thing there is.
I think that's it.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Yeah.
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
No. I'm gonna wait.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
No?
On the floor?
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop don't like Johnny.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
It was a miracle.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Oh.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I don't know.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I am alone in the world.
It's nothing!
None of your business.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Don't shit where you eat.
Why do men chase women?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Sure.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
What would he be doing down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I knew she had it.
Did you dress her up like this?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Through ... We found them.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
NI!   NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
Course I have.
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
What does it say?
Quite.
A G...g...g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I warned you!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your name?
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Listen, Alice ...
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Yes?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
What is your name, handsome knight?
Sir Galahad!!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, I'm not.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I didn't.
No, no, no.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
You know nothing about her!
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Louder, girl!
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
It is quite late enough.
Back and upper corridors.
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
That's not good enough.
Aye, do.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
It's nothing.
I'm not married.
I do what I do.
In time, she will.
She's well, too.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Are they worth reading?
What does he know about the Highlands?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
You can't know that for sure.
Who?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No, indeed.
Whom?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
A few days, ma'am.
We were expecting you to return by six.
What is it?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Hey, kid.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's twelve-thirty!
You imagined it.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
What?
I was afraid you'd say that.
No I'm not...
Put in a quarter.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Yes I am...
Check your read-out.
What?!  There's nothing here!
We don't have a choice!
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Never been on a snowboard.
I'm okay.
And then keep on driving?
Sign me up.
No.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Howdy to you.
I agree with what you said...truly.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
How's that?
Okay, I'm thinking.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
May I have your name please?
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
I'm not sure about this.
"Before what?"
I'm all right.
Do you know them?!
But I want to.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Not a coke or anything?
Where's the dock ?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
What's going on ?
No time. Get him up.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
What ?
I'm not listening.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Let's go.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Hey , Hey !
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
A dragon.
What the fuck are you talking about.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
He probably has a history of this shit.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Better, sir.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
I was.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
I'm listening.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
I'm fine.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Me, I'll know!
Suspended from school, my mother??
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
I'm leaving Sunday.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well you know what I mean.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Have fun.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
You are?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
oh.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
I won't.
You're so clever.
MOM!
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
What difference does it make?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
Change my name.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Give it to me!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Good. I mean...
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Part adventure...part miracle.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Bye.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Not exactly.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
I'm impressed.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
What Hurts Vada?
Yes they are.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I wrote that.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
It's nice.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Want to what?
I'll second that.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
I love this guy! 
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Why?
Sorry.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Yes.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
There were just too many of 'em.
Get away, get away!!
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh come on.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Oh, Vada...
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He likes her.
Probably.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I am.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Can I use your bathroom first?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
Liverpool?
What are you saving for?
I can't, I have to go home.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
What?
For their meat.
I am running faster!!
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
He likes her better than me.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Part of being a New Yorker.
The wandering sportswriter.
I have a suggestion...
I can see why.
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
The man you love.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I can't even say it.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
I've missed a step.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Exactly.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He won't get mad, huh?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
That's entirely understandable.
... look good on Kimberly.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Well, somet...
... Thomas, yeh.
Mirrors.
She finds him "personable."
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Yes.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
A bad combination.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
DON'T SPEAK!
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
... and you knew about this.
Well, if that's the way you f...
MICHAEL!!
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
I know that, Star.
You're so good.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Green.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
Whose word?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
Whose?
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
I'll just be in here.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
I'm not really a musician.
Suits me.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
Oh.
Yea.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Hello.
Might be good for you.
You're not.
Oh?
Did it break?
Do you study at all?
Where is she?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Sure thing.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Susanville, Soledade.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
She was born without a tongue.
What?
It's video.
Ready.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
How 'bout Manson?
All right, Mickey.
Do you miss Mallory?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Okay, let's cut it.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
No.
No fuckin' way!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
I hear ya. Play.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Thanks.
Wayne Gayle.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Yeah, sure.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
No thanks.
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
That's right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Well, what d'you know?!
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Where was that?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Guess I don't.
Well, he worked around.
Yeah, I been there.
You must be new in town.
Went to college, huh?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
You got a problem all right.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
No.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Uh-huh. Why?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Huh?
You will.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Like what?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What's on your mind?
Better get him to a hospital.
Okay.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I doubt it.
Don't look like there's a right way.
It's for your own good.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
What's the matter now?
Since when?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
I'm fine.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
I'd say you were full of shit.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
You son of a bitch...
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
I find out now.
Can you read my mind?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Can you walk?
Jah guides us.
How are we doing?
Can you take me to it?
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
How long, Dixie?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Couple of months.
What the fuck... are you serious?
A regular Fagan.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
What went down between you and Riviera?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
...And if I guess wrong?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Nice.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Oh I know.
Thanks.
Petty good.
Leave.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Do I want to be crunched?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
See!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
I can't do this.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Yes, desperately.
I know.
Sorry. Forgetful.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Why do you do that?
When are you going to open your eyes?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
For this.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Maybe he doesn't know...
Oh, come on Dad...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Only the wet ones.
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Who?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
yeah, I had a bad night.
Why won't you talk to me?
I killed him!  I killed him!
I can't!
Hi.
'Morning, honey.
You okay?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
Thanks, Mom.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I thought I'd wait for you.
He's full of shit.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
What?
Fuck off.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Thank you.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
What's that supposed to mean?
Didn't get much sleep.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
So do I.
Remember -- open mind.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
No...
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Mary Helena.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
I won't allow it.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm delighted.
Now you're lying.
Night, night, Honey.
Fifteen million dollars.
Fine.
Hi.
Oh -- Okay.
Hello.
Yes.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
That's fine.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
No, you were brilliant
I don't know, I'm afraid.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
This is the place.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
You and every person in this country.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Who was Gilda?
How do you think I'm doing?
You do?
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
I haven't decided.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Is that right?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes -- sort of...
Well, thanks, that's great.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Any bit in particular?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Point taken.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
No -- you're right.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Will you come with me, please.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry, ma'am.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
H-H-Hearts.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
God Bless America.
No.
Ca-na-da...
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Through the ass.
A pecking party?
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
No!
Yesterday...
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Yeah, Mac?
Me too! Me too!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
In what way?
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Good. Good.
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Are you a doctor?
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Martini out!
'Kay...
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
You's better believe it, brother!
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Hi.
Thank you, ma'am,
Tha's your problem.
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
You ol' fucker!
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
--separate, in the evening..."
Yes.  We did.
Dwayne?
What's mezzaluna?
No.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Non.  Please.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
What?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Who says I don't love him?...
Please.  I need to know.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
You too.
No.  Course not.
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Uh huh.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Yes you did.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
What is it?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Her brother.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Is he looking at us?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Packing.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
When you could've found one in America.
And Larry?...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Oh.
I thank you.
That's exactly what you are.
No, why?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Went to high school with him. But...
He missed me.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Thanks.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
In a minute.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Which side are you with?
You training to be a nun or something?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
That was nice of you.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I am?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What a fruitcake you are!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I know... I know... .
Who says?
What I did to Joey.
Edie— it's—
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Get out of my way.
Well, it's over.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry...?
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Mind your own business, Father.
You go to—
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Are you on the level, Father?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Raise a hand to me and... .
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Looking for me?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hey look-
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Forty-five bills.
By way of Chicago?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
How'd you get that.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
I was only talkin' to her.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
Of course I do.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Well then let us proceed.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Tell me, how do you do that?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Thank you.
Yes.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He knows where she lives?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Forty-five minutes.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yeah, I did.
And who watches your back?
I don't ski.
Jack --
In the trunk, yeah?
You have to know what you're talking about.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
I'll need a last known address.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
That's right.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
We're leaving.
A little.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Uh-huh.
Bleeding on a country road.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Shit...
Yes.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
It would be worth the risk.
So do you.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
Why are you mad?
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
When?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Islamic.
For a time.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Me?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Oh...
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
What do you want?
Thanks.
The State Theater?
Something better.  Open it.
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What're you doing at Glades?
We don't get to talk much any more.
What'd I say?
No?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I didn't have time.
Like a fag.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Still...
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Sir?
Sir, I --
Where's that lizard?
You guys are new?
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
He did.
Power dive!
Yeah.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Come on!
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Hang on.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Respect.
You too, Lieutenant.
We're all going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
All of 'em.
I'm not telling.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Good—bye, Grandma.
Stag movies. Smokers.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
It's that jerk Walter.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Refresh my memory.
They'll learn to live with it.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Who?
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
What am I going to do with you?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
I've got to go now.
What about Janet?
I'll never give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Don't you get along with your parents?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
For everyone.
I hate chickens.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
Can we split now?
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Doing some shopping?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Oh. I forgot.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Why not? They're my favorite.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
But accidents can happen.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
What was?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I	know what a burrito is.
I don't know.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Am I dead or not?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
Come on. You can't be serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
I... um...
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Anywhere but here.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
What did?
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Sorry...
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I am relaxed.
That's not what I said.
No.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Of course.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Funny.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
We?
Continue.
Makeup.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
Fine.
They didn't fire her?
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It's fine.
Do you... pray?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
What?
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
No.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Is that a question?
What did you say?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
That's correct.
I might.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Not especially.
Who?
Probably since she was born.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Yeah... ?
Night, honey.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Helloooo...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Show me your eyes.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
<u>Listen</u>.
Think about what?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Get out of our way.
You sure you can keep --
Riddick? How close?
We can't make it.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
I would try for them.
Can we switch?
Hey, who?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Like what?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
How many?
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
For now.
What?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Said "looks clear."
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About the girl.
No. She's not.
Just realized that, huh?
Not if I'm the one.
Nice embellishment.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Just the same, I want one.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Huh?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Don't bother
Okay.
He wouldn't leave her.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
My name is Taylor.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Taylor, you can't.
Why not?
We can't.
God bless you.
He doesn't know.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
How the hell did he get away?
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Fuck you bitch.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Yeah.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Who gives a shit!
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
These two holes are yours...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Just drunk enough.
How long would that take?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
What did you say his name was?
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
Couldn't be.
Nothing matters.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
Do you have to leave the note?
Wonder what?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Ale. I don't mind.
It is?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
We wouldn't have met at all.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
Is it a crime?
The police always do, don't they?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
What will they do to you?
I know that.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Got the information on you?
Fascinated.
I've got good ears.
Round of golf Saturday?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off, can't you?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't think you locked your door.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
So it seems Sergeant.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
I've met her.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I think so.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Not quiet yet.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
The card says so, doesn't it?
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Who's the girl?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
It's kind of you to see me.
It's fine, thank you.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
I will, thanks.
What went wrong?
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Thank you.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
Both dead.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Will it be fun?
Fuck off.
Hello.
Have you come to talk about me?
What about the Cromwells?
Dad.
Promise?
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
You gotta earn trust.
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You do it... you first!
You first!
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Sir?
Zero distortion, sir.
Caught my first tube this morning.
That's the point, isn't it?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
The fucking punks are surfers.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Got it...
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
This Zen master surfer.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Catch of the day.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What are you talking about?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
What do you mean?
Something... in the trees...
No way, old buddy.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Anytime.
What, Sergeant?
I saw it.
I'll take him.
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
What's that, General?
There's something else, Major...
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
He's not really my uncle.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Storage, I think.
What?
You've got a lot of nerve.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
You're making the right decision, sir.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
What's that?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Fine.
What?
Why?
Off the boulevard.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Oooh, thank god.
Mmm, I could tell.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
What are assets?
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Of course.  How much?
All right, two thousand.
Any good?
You're forgiven.
Television?
I have work to do.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
He's good at what he does.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
Where are you taking me!?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
We just did.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Let him answer.
He's not gonna want us.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Do I!?  Momma!
What?
I leave extras, miss.
And who is that?
Professionally?
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
'Scume me.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
So it's to be torture.
I swear it will be done.
Of course.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
You're a silly girl.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It never happened.
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
I'm waiting!
What do I do?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
I have a little.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
What?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
I don't be-leeve this.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Sire.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Who won? How did it end?
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
He's already dead.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Oh, have it your way.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
I smell nothing.
Hmm.
You've made your decision then7
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
An hour.
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
What are you saying?
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
But what if the play was a hit?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Liebkind, no!
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
No kidding?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Nice girl.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
The Blue Max...
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I'm not the police.
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
No one met her?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Back where?
She isn't still here, is she?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
If she paid you well?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
All right.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
A lot?
Lila.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
You've led a charmed life.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
Just wait here?
You're not.
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sam, let's go get married.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Los Angeles.
I'd like to.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You'd know, of course.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Please... I'd like to go...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Fine.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Leave me alone!
Did I?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
I don't know--I can't tell--
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Why didn't you notify the police?
You found Buckley?
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
I'm losing my blood!
Yes!
But ... the dogs...
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I don't agree with you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
You mean he was colored?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
You give me a pain!
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
How's every little thing?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
That is unfortunate.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
You're insane.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
Yes....
What universe are you in, Paul?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Where is she?
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
You were pretty bad, huh?
What did you expect?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
But Rose...
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Okay.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
I don't know.
Yeah, he's still up there.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
She's watching the car again?
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing, Doll?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Here comes Daddy.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
No, son, she is dead.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
What?
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Over... my... dead... body!
Fine.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, sir.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
You can stop it right now.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Be quiet, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I don't mind.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Now you know what to watch for...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
I'm just saying...
I got him.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
What?
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
It's not gonna happen.
Wha... ?
Bullshit.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
We have to find Kittle.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Well, sir...
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Absolutely.
Shit.  You're right.
You think this is so easy?
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
Sounds good.
Who is that... ?
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Yeah.
I can't kill my own father.
Who are you?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Leia!
That's all any of us can see.
I don't know.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right, hang on.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Let's see.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Here goes nothing.
Never-r-r!
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
No, don't do that.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Yes.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Now I
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
That ain't no crime
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
...I'm sorry.
...I suppose.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I sold them to you.
Yes, I do.
Could ya take off that hat.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
-- The legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Yeah...
Apollo?
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
That so.
Don't talk like that to him!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
You're hurtin', man!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Move your shoulders down.
No wine.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Charge it.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
What's happenin' here?
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
No action.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
...Thanks.
Rocky.
Sparrin'?
I like yella teeth.
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Spider Rice.
Message -- What message?
How do you mean?
Yeah.
Ya got heart.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I got pain an' experience too.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
...No.
Whatta you think?
What?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
...People talk to me more.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Shoulda guessed.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
I'll bet.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Surprised?
What am I, Earl?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
What a gasser.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
That was the idea.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Forget it.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
From this box here...
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Am I like Such a fellow?
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
In love?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
At thy good heart's oppression.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Amen
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I thought all for the best.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
I'm up for that...
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
It's been known to happen.
You lose them!
Not yet...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
You sure about this?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I think not.  After you...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Enough!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
That's it.
Of course.  Don't you?
How did you know?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Not for long.
My way is better.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
You should learn a little patience.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
As in, they own it?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
A lot of people died.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I know of him.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I don't know...
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Why not?
Closest and oldest.
What?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gone.  Destroyed.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill him?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I hear you.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Hell, it won't be us!
We'll figure something out.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
At the expense of six people.
I don't know.
What's that?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
He saw everything!
That's not what I mean.
I don't know...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's NOT too late!
Uh huh.
What's your offer, Jesse?
How much?
Two thousand...
None of us like it!
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Hi.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
I know.
I love you Sally.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Could it have been this?
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
This just might be our ticket!
What are you getting at?
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Lingerie...
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Calm down --
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Yeah.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Absolutely positively.
So someone did get away.
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
So what's your story?
Lee, you okay?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I am a tourist.
How you doin'?
This is a very dangerous man.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Who?
I'm okay, you go.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Good at what?
Ask me if I give a shit.
IT IS CRAZY!
You said --
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
Excuse me?
What's going on?
Gimme the binoculars.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
No mu-shu.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Dancing?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
No.  I'm going to find out.
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Excuse me?
Why don't you go get them?
No.  But I'll help you.
It's my responsibility.
Don't.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Don't go there...
Stooly.
Yeah, it's good.
Good God, ya'll!
This concrete?  This is still America.
I am from outa town.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
The Feds?!
What's wrong with that?
They put you in charge?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
It's called a dress.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Nobody touches me.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
She's fine.
It's Griffin.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
Thank you.
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
"Make the shot."
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
What?
I already made an appointment for later today.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Are you a reporter?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Yes.
You have one?
We think so.
You can turn that finger around.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
You afraid to try?
Still sweet.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Highly suspect.
Agreed.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Of what?
Missed me bad, huh?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I love you, too.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Where?
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Why?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Not eight...
Good boy, Port Hole.
Thank you, Dad.
No, you tell her.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
It sounds nice.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Nope.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Walter, I'd love to --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Does it have wheat in it?
You couldn't.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I think that's what I'm saying.
What was what?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
I always wondered about that too.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
Okay.
A sense of humor.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Come on, Jonah --
Yes.
Any time.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
It's a sign.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
It's me?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
What's she talking about?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Why not?
You want me to talk to him?
Right, right.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
What is it?
I don't think I have to now.
It's a spice rack.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
What?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Now I'm late.  Bye.
There she is.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
It's a short word.
Who is Annie?
It might be in the kitchen.
This is the one I like.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
No.
It was all they had.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
Hi.
You look good yourself.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
No thanks.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
I don't make policy.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
I did forget. Luís told me.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
They say I am no good to you.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You mean Delaware?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
I was talking to my wife.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
How about in the house?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Ouch.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Why not?
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
And you admire that?
I try.
Nothing.
This has nothing to do with him.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Ass first into the world.
It's Tom.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Twelve
I know a guy.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
I can't tell you.
I don't trust anybody.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Understand what?
No, I'm good.
Hey, I don't play that.
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Just some buddies.
Yeah, dickhead.
You go, boy.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
When?
This chink have a name?
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
My name is Tom.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
It speaks!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
And what does this have to do with me?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Again, I thank you.
There's no motels around here.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Now that's scary!
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
What is it, drugs?
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
Where are your men now?
Spit it out, Captain.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Shit, that was no big deal.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I'd love to hear it.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Pass.
You think the rest of us were?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
You don't count.
I changed my mind.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Since when have things been normal?
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Yeah, how so?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
But we accomplish the mission.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
HERE THEY COME!
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
And Sarge?
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Twenty-four-five.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I hope you understand.
He's a mess!
C'mon Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
I admit nothing.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Read it.
Come on, it's graduation.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Bon voyage.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Alright.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah.  What a day.
No, I read it on the message.
Well, not monumentally.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Eight.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Okay.
Be friends?
You're shaking.
It was wonderful.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Just my dad.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Uh... okay... um...
Yeah.  Honey?
I'm totally and completely serious.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
Your car?
Dude, I can't do it!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
I called her up.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Alright.  Key?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
In Breslau.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
They're not gone, they're here.
He's important to my business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
It's good business.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Yeah, I can.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
Nice things cost money.
She's good.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Wine?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
They should be.
Yes.
What other point is -
Stern.
They're withholding payment.
There will be generations because of what you did.
You did so much.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
That doesn't work, sir.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
On national television.
thought he was doing AA.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
No, it's me.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
What?
Did you do it?
No, I don't.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
No, it's not.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Good question. You took the bait.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Or it found us.
Just for you, Sid.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
I see you read the book.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Just in case...
I'll give you one guess.
What if your life depended on it?
It's what you want from me.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Where is your attacker?
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
I counted four.
But...
..harmonica style is okay.
But she's standing right next to you.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Do I?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
More of a game really.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
There's more.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
What Rielly?
Sid I can see you!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Good twist.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Huh, fine.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Yes.
How do I know their voices are --
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Who the fuck is this?
Oh yeah.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You lost your mom...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
What?
To apologize.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You're making popcorn?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Don't...
I told you not to hang up on me.
I'm getting scared.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
No...
NOOO!
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Answer the question and I will.
What?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Mind if I join you?
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
...yeah...
Afraid not.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Have you contacted the bureau?
Yes, sir.
I told you to send it back.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
I owe you shit.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Who are you?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
What happened?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
They think it's school-related?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain't it?
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
It's always been like this.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
It's not too far away now.
Why?
David... please...
Spit it out.
Delusions of grandeur.
What the fuck is going on here?!
What the fuck is going on?
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
What?
Hello.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Forced what?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
And you don't?
Oh, that's all.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
You got to be kidding.
How is this legal?
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
I'm fine.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You do your job...
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Wait!
I can't let you do this...
Don't do this... please...
I'm sorry, I only...
You should look into private schools.
I want to have children.  It's just...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
What, Ben?
Huh...? No...no water.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
No sir...pleasure.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
How many, would you say?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Sir?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
You've done a lot of growin'...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Scar?
Think it might be...?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Nine...  Ten!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Never heard of him...
Over there!
We won't be here...Come on!
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
I got to fetch her home...
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Oh God, Tommi...
It still worked in town.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
But what is the truth?
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
1976.  What happened back then?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Tenth floor.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Writer, is he?
Twenty pounds on delivery
Ask him.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
When I have fifty pounds.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Done.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Who is that?
That's me.
A share of the profits.
Very well.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
it will be all right, madam.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
What do we do now?
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I thought your play was for Burbage.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Your Majesty
Oh, but they can!
"Madam!"
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Yes, some of it is speakable.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I was the more deceived.
You cannot marry Wessex!
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Nor you for me.
My lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
Virginia?!
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
My hat?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
You are on my ground.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Will you shut up and play.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Dig the pit, I don't know.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
I just thought we should discuss it.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Just stop worrying.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Cover it?
Yes.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
What?
Yes.
Really?
For the flat.
She hated you --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
His car's still there.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Open it.
Yes.
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
That's not him.
Then let's spend some money.
No, no, it's different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Oh, good.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
No.
You were going to say something.
Yeah.
Of course.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
That wasn't a question.
Yes.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
No.
Two hundred pounds?
No one.
You and me?
I'm not sure --
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
It's a breeze.
Did he sound upset?
Is it real?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
What do you expect me to do about it?
Gee, that's very serious...
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
But you don't know what happened.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I hope she's all right.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Her?
It isn't?
Hello.
Yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not!
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Buffums?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
He's a very private person, actually.
Probably the bathroom.
Yeah... I mean great.
Whew.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Yeah, baby...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
Fuckin' A --
You were great.
You were great.
Sammy's?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
We're friends.
-- you've got to leave.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't go, Jackie...
No, man.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- Oh yeah.
-- Oh my yes.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
What're you talking about?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
How?
How did it go at the bank?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
When I get off work.
I'll call you.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Ha, ha.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know, that's all.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Did you?
No?
Well, yeah.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
I know what you mean.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Layered?
Well... who are those guys?
Now wait a minute...
But...
Who?
Oh yeah...
Lester, it just happened.
No --
Yes I do.
Wasn't sure it was you.
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Is that right?
Then you were talking to him.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Really? How about starting with tonight?
What's that?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Who is that?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I'm exaggerating.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Honey?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
That's right.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well... sure...
-- oh I don't know --
You're going.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
No.
What was the Donner party?
Dad?
Yes, Dad.
Try to think what it was.
Is there something bad here?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Okay, Mom.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
I won't, Mom.
Danny, come here!
Talking to Tony.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Where does he go?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well how can I repay you?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
That's right, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Grady... oh.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Nice to meet you.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What time is it?
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Which room was it?
Yes.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Why?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stop swinging the bat.
Wendy...
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh, I'll say.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
How do you do?
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Let me help you up.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Do I need one?
What the hell does that matter?
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
You want to know what I think?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Perhaps.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Were you tempted?
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Good evening, Vincent.
Oh-huh.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Am I?
Enough jabber.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Amateurs 2
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Three years.  Sister.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
What?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
You watch yourself!
Mary Clarence!
We're nuns!
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
It's true!
Enough joking.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
Would you like that?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
My what?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
But...
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
He didn't do you a favor.
Maybe Hawaii.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Me too.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Really.
We didn't tell you what?
It didn't work, Vince.
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
Really...
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's better than ice cream.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She's our inspiration!
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
How did you hear this?
Two days... ?  For murder?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Hmm?  See them?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
I shall, gladly.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Should we go back?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Stay back.
We should go.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I doubt that's the end.
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
What?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
The skull is gone.
And, what did he say?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What would you have me believe?
No.  She has gone out.
What... ?
What did you say?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Doctor, he is awake.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Can I see him?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
What you got in there, warshing?
He does make some funny noises.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
It went real good.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Childers.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I aim to kill you with it.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Childers.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
I thought they was.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
All right then.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Mama?
I love you, too, Mama.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yeah.
Me, too.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
I'll be dog.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Okay.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Not really to speak of.
How long have you been standing here?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Can I help you, sir?
I know.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
Before they were married?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
American literature. What else?
What's the difference?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
You got it.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
It means "happiness."
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
And how much are these?
And these?
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
And his parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
And you told your nephew about it?
And?
Jesus.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Huh?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
What time is it?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
I just did.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
His only copy?
Is it yours?
Yeah, I picked it up.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You don't.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
You done your math right.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Why not?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
It seems human.  To me.
You're implying th...
Easy.  Slow is best.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection!
Objection!  Speculation.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Have a look.  At nothing.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Fell.
The knife.  What knife?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
It is.
Apparently.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
I wouldn't say encouraged.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Bye.
Get lost, will you?
Beat it, Buster.
Hey, she's ticklish!
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Now you tore the other one.
Polish?
Fight it.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm engaged.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like what?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I'll say.
Good night, honey.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Interesting.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
When?
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
I hope so.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
You like it?
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - here and there - and around.
What's the big idea?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You don't say.
I'm not surprised.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Most of the time I slap it.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Who?
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
We'll take it!
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Oh.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I'll say.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You are?
About what?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
My fault.
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Tonight?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
If it's at all possible -
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
I am?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
It's all right for a bachelor.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
You're flattering me.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Nothing at all?
Talk about sad.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Thanks just the same.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Mineral baths - now really!
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
From a rich millionaire.
Me?
I knew you would.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Coffee?
Go where?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
You and who else?
Yes, sir.
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Bacardi 151.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Hello, Katmandu.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
A weekend?
This happened to you?
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Shampoo, got it!
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
It’s my job.
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Hi.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Thank you.
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
That's right--
What he talk 'bout?
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
But where is my daddy!?
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Where was you, Daddy?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Goodnight to you, son...
Come here, son...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
David, come back here!
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Listen, Mama...
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Did you find your father?
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Little chilly.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Is there something I can do to help you?
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Very funny!
How the fuck should I know!!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Help yourself prickfuck!
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Eric?
A hunger strike? For what?
Uhh...
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
MOM!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
For pooping, silly.
Kay.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
Totally!
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Me?!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Yes?
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
You bet, Terrance!
I sure did, Phillip!!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hi Stan.
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Oh Sara...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Of course, of course...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Taylor, you surprise me.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
That's me.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
That's clear.
Will you shut up already?
That's right.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I understand.
So we did.
Why?  Where are you going?
I'm about to blow the wall.
How does the distress signal look?
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Is there anything I can help you with?
I guess so.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
That's affirmative.
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
He's my dad.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
It was a clearance.
No kiddin'.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Wait! That's an aria!
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm not on the tour this year.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Thanks.
She's my mom.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
See ya 'round Maynard.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
SHEILA!
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
I like the sport the way it is.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Bowling "Center"!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Yippy!
How do you want it?  The eggs.
It's a vicious cycle.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
We'll get into that later.
Plan B is your dad.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Zip.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
We would have sooner or later.
Are you sure he's dead?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I am a professional man.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
I can't see...
What is it?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
High Voltage?
Now!
What team?
Nothing else.
A thousand feet.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
They're coming.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Please watch your closest monitor...
He understands me fine.
She's not gonna know, sir.
She's not gonna know.
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
What's inside the sphere.
It never occurred to me.
Yeah.  Drowning.
Get this thing off me.
The library.
What?
You don't trust me?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
He what?
But why is he doing it?
Something for burns.
Tarazine?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Antibiotic.
I'll just boost the doses.
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
C'mon -- what?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
But I have to, Norman.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Leave me alone, Norman.
I --
Hear what?
By the bunks.
Who says it's a he?
It's an American spacecraft.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
In time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Fine.  I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Look, would you --
To what?
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
What is it, Harry?
That far in what, Harry?
What are they?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Shut up and open the door.
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
You got her?
I'm trying.  There.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Please.  It must have flown here --
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Does this mean what I think it means?
The others, sir?
No, they didn't say --
Captain who?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
I don't see anything.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Not that I know of.  Why?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
This isn't a game, you know.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
You could put it that way.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Was this trip really necessary?
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
It's automatic.
Why?
Not if this tunnel deadends.
With four casualties?!
He'll be well cared for.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
I read you sir.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
I didn't see him !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Hey, check it.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
So who's got time to get married ?
Excuse me...!
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
I don't want everyone to see.
How do I know if this is love ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Should I be ?
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
How are you, Carl ?
Thank you, ma'am.
No way, ma'am !
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Sure.
Guess you gotta go.
You saying you didn't ?
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Looks like rain.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Here in Buenos Aires.
Courage, I guess.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Hi, mom.
Good for you. Go find out.
What's going on, Diz ?
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
We're not leaving you here, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
That is logical. You may procede.
That is how V'ger will survive.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Decker....!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Our... 'insignificance'?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
To you, sir?
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Sure plan to.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
What's it called?
It's in your play.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
Of course.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Everyday things...yes.
Mmm.
You're still here.
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
Yes.
Cast stood me up.
You got a paperclip?
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
The other side.
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Is it...
Now you're talking...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
I saw...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
What are they offering?
That's so beautiful...
We had a date.
Who is this person that you've found?
No.  Don't tell me that.
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
That Could Be.
Nothing happened.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
I...
I swear that that woman in my room...
She's a...
You can go...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
I've always seen that.
You mind...?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I'm ready!
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Well, what's the beef?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
But we...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I just...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yes, yes, but...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
He treated me as if I were a child...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Well.
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, this is Mr...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
You were in the car with Bob?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
How about that.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
For what cause?
No.
I don't know.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
We don't have the money.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Is he cool or angry?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Sherry, this...
And we're glad to have you here...
Mmm...
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I hate when you say that.
It happens.
Or blush.  You look pale.
I'll be there for you.
I bet.
Secret's safe with me.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Don't. Take me with you.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
This is my daddy's house --
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Honey, she won't d...
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Ice cold water.
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves you.
Alright starve.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Where are you, anyway?
Pray.  We never find out.
Rache can do that part.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
I'm worried.
WE are over.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
We're going to win this.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Don't flatter yourself.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
You're a cross-dresser.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have to talk.
Jesus.
Rache, get out of th...
It's no biggie.
I know that.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Oh, yeah?
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Yes, Mikey?
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
My Jesus…
My grandchild-baby.
For rape and murder.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Yes, Mikey?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Is everything OK?
I dunno.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
What's tomorrow?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
You know he hated my story also.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Hi, Dad!
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I know.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Y-yes--
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Who's got matches?
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Yeah?...
Used to Filmore, used to.
What are you talking about?
Even better.
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Where does it lead?
Are you going to kill us?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Yes, you should.
Shut up!
I don't want any...
He's in there...
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
What do you mean?
What the hell is it, anyhow?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Yes, of course.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I know nothing of the sort!
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
What?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say?
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
You're right, sir.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Just a squirt.
That's close enough, Major.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Admiral Buldike?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Lothar, take your checks now.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Ready, Major.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Seond safety.
Master Kong.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Why should they call us back?
Like hell it does.
I don't get you, King.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Sorry, King.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
I don't anymore.
Yeah.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Was it okay?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
The dude wants it.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Okay, okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, last night...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
You know?
Erica is in the van back there.
She's in the van.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Yeah.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Good. See you later.
Oh, you were there?
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!
A reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Military marching bands.
Mm.
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
Yeah?
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
It does look good.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Will you just put the gun down?
Is that Bee-Bee?
I hate that.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
So you can give me more shit?
Like what?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Sooze.
Us.
Nothing.
Mm-hm.
Yes, you do.
Jeff!
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
For a ride.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Just go.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Alright!
That was so great!
I can't believe you're still here.
That's because I am.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
You do?
Oh, my god!
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Whatever.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
It's twins!!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
No...I've been pregnant.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
And they get caught!
She thinks you went to the police.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Spit from your dad?
Y'think?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Trix...
That was gas, Sweetie.
We're here for you, Diane.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Bullets.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hold on...
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
In a deep freeze.
Close, but no cigar.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Why, you sweet kid.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
You'll be waiting for me?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Nobody can be that busy.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Twenty-two.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
No.
Yeah?
Why?
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Thank you.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
What's wrong with It?

I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I think I'll read a little.
Why do you say that?
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Dressed for what?
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
He will be. In about five minutes.
It's what we were warned about.
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Later.
I have to.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
It seemed that way to me.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
I don't see why not.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I don't want your help.
I could force you.
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
I've got things to do.
Nice to meet you.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Can you create life?
This is all your clothes?
But what for?
It was just a trim.
It doesn't seem right.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'd love to.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Cigarette?
Throw him out.
I have to talk to you.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
A cheap trick.
For what?
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
I know.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
You thought that?
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, thanks.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Mmmmm . . .
At one o'clock in the morning?
What are you doing?
Kitchen. . . Technician
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Decaffeinated too?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Fair's fair.
We've already got some.
What will it get me?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Just a second.
I didn't have my camera with me.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Missing????
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Hello.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Don't cry, Bubba.
What's wrong?
We can get to work on that oil!
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
She'll be fine.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
What??
Maybe you wanted to.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Say you love me.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I'm sorry.
Everything on it.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Now This I want to hear.
Sensible enough.
No possibility for parole?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Yes?
We must combine our strength.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
An angle?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I am master now.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Bunkers!
Thank you.
We're running out of smoke.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
I know.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Well!
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Unbelievable.
Oh.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Not unless you can fly.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
You're on.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
La de da da...
We just take it?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
What's your name, boy?
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
He'll be weightless.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
195 pounds.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
Maybe I should get help.
How are you?
Which one?
That's okay.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Okay.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
When the game's over, I guess.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Sure.
Good night.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
You talked about it?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Did his parents attend to that?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Yes.
Why would he be frightened?
I'll just strap it on the roof.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Did he say what about?
That's what he said.
The people in the town?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
And what was the weather like at this time?
She...she was a friend of mine.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
People who will help our cause.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
So what's the problem?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes.
Well, let's see what we get.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Do you have this agreement with you?
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You remember that much?
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Dolores was driving too fast.
No.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Really?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Nothing.
Very slick.
It's okay.
As opposed to this T.V.?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
You don't know that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Alone or surrounded?
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
No.  I'm going home.
Can I come in for a minute?
I have a message from your sister.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I'll listen one more minute.
Are you finished?
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
In his apartment -
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
What sort of thing?
He wants me to break a leg?
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
I'm used to you...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It is a favor, isn't it?
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Let me try mine.
My mission is to protect you.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Cool.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Smile?
No.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
She intends to change the future somehow.
I order you not to!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Ready.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Open the goddamn door!
So do you.
Correct.
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Can you get us in there, past security?
Yes.
Relax now, Sarah --
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
Five minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
With more what? More what?
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
That's what I asked.
Helmuth.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Never heard of him, who is he?
His private life?
Sure.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
What's it to ya?
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
That's the way it was told to me.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I want it to be over for you.
No.  Never.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Yes.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I know.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Oh, no... you.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
I don't think he's breathing.
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
Never mind.
You first.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Well... the red bra.
I don't...
Get out of my car!
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
You call them...
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Fuck you.
That's not true...
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Boyfriend?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Elizabeth?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
You dodged a bullet.
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Yes, very lucky.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
What kind of vacation?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Don't take another step.
Have we met?
The key?
Have a nice day.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
His behavior... ?
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I know who she is.  Take a message.
Why are you following me?
You know you can.
Attempted murder.
What?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I did okay.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Why?
Go ahead.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
No.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
It was.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
It's okay... we're all here...
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
Nell, what do we do?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
I know.
You're okay.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
I have a loft.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Then what good is he?
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
We think?
Come over here.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Round about, yeah.
It was better than a telegram.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
I only asked.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Not me, man.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Well, those are the breaks.
It's been a while.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
That's what was estimated.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Depends, don' it.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
How do you know?
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Five thousand.
Good luck.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Since when?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
I don't want you here, Terry.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
I don't.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Boy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Geez, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Way out of line.
Yeah.
It's OK.
That'll be fine.
Uh-huh.
How's business, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Come on in.
Honey?
*I* was with her.
I took Doris's keys.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
He a good man?
So, who should I--
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Yeah.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
...Nah.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Homicide.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
What's the combination?
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Call me Vince.
So the method of death is the only connection?
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
The sub-basement?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Oh shit.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I don't believe it.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Footsteps!
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Holy mother, what is that?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Quiet.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of hormones?
Maybe not.
A monster?
You were behind me?  Running after me?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium!
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
How?
I have to shoot.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
What's to see?
What have we missed?
That and a fat, new contract.
Amnesia.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Saturday?
Now.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Nursery?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
How about them?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I made macaroni.
Good night, Mother.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Well, I made it through another night.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
I'll try.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
You can count on it.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Looking for him for what?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
You're looking for a bomb.
I think they have that covered.
How's that?
No you didn't.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
No.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Evidence of a massive infection.
Mulder --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
All the equipment is brand new.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
For the purpose of what?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
General McAddie's.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I'm not taking any chances.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
What happened?
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Then what is he?
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
It doesn't matter...
No problem.
That hoist, with the winch...
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
I think that's the whole point.
What's wrong?
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
I'll get her...
Absolutely.
No.
Dr. Kent.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Considering where I've been...
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
We're both in it, Harry.
Wait here.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
A parrot...Let it go.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Oh, the usual things...
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Of course.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
I have never seen him.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
They'll be returned, miss.
I don't...
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
No, not yet.
No.
Holly Martins.
Best thing that ever happened...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
I see.
No.
Which side of the road?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
I'll look it up for you.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
I told the police.
You wouldn't do anything.
You can get somebody else...
Why not?
You've got plenty of contacts.
What do you want?
Coffee.
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
I understand...
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Yes.
Now, hold on.
Funny?
Never.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Okay.
Help you out?
Here.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
That's the wrong one.
We're ok.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
It's on an island that no one get to.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Uh-huh.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They don't have extermination camps.
He's an asshole.
What??
Who the fuck are you?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What do you care?
Why?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
That's stupid.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
V'asitem...
No difference.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
And be crushed.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Did you see how they reacted to him?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
It's the truth....
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
What??!?
Notice? Like what...?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
I can't help what I think.
You do it on the inside....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
Here...
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
Why? Why would she?
Where?
I can tell....
What are you trying to say?
Dennis Leary.
They're not that Jewish.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I can't... I just don't know how to...
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Congratulations.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Have you known him long?
Italy!
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Lira?
What does that mean?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
Fine!
Great!
... And his friend, Johana...
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I don't want to erase anything.
... Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Who?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
I don't know... why?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Johana... New York.
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Louis, we were French!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
I said, do you come here often!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Yes Esther.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Mazel Tov!
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Worse.
Good looking?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
I sleep it off.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What do you want to see him for?
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Let me see it ——
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Tomorrow -—
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
That's right, of course.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No.
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It's better you don't know.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
Thanks, Sheriff.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Yeah.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
You... You found that at Leon’s?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Have you got a pen?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Leon could still have hung himself.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
You splendid bastard...
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
You... Fuck you!
...On holiday?
Good.
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
When... I’m told he came here...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
We conclude our transaction.
Anything at all?
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
How are you, Rhian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Good reasons?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
... No.
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Could that be Camden Market?
Cinq cents.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
What do you think, huh?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Shut up and walk...
What’s that? A word?
Yes, my lord.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Now?
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
I promise...
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I -- I don't understand...
Good.
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
What about you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not long ago...
Yes.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
Buying her?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
I know...
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Not yet.
Damn right!
No good?  This is a disaster!
Perfectly.
No... not like this...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
The clothes are not important...
No...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
No!
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Here -- take this instead.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Don't swear...
I'd sooner die than use magic!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
I said, kneel!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Playing...
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Yes!
Oh no?  How about this one?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes, it is.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Who wants me to stop?
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Let's find out.
How will we sleep?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What's happened?
It costs.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
It certainly was.
That makes a change.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Yes, but what good did it do?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Can you help? I've no money...
Wladek! How are you?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You're a dirty pig!
Stop it, Wladek.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
In the attic.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Like it were a piano?
There is something to be said for silence
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Yes, it's unholy.
No, no bible readers.
I'll be back.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
He chopped it off
That's right.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Naw, it's okay.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
What do we do?
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We'll be waitin'.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Forget it.
Which one?
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
I never played for winos.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
It was too noisy.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Where's June today?
Where you goin'?
Yeh, sleepin'.
Okay, Tootsie.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
Yeh, he knows that.
Then why the rat?
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
I am after this race.
You got a system, Carver?
He's right, Les.
How am I gonna do that?
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
No.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Said he stole his invention.
Don't cry.
What are you talking about?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
And I'll give then proof!
Yes.
Disappeared!
I've got to see you alone!
Which way did she fall?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Forgive me.  How are you?
A new invention?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
I'm very interested in that body.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
We were looking for this bird.
No.
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Nunheim!
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Well, what?
When was that?
Did you go?
Let him have his say out.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
I guess all the suspects are here.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
You've said that for weeks.
All right.  All right.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
So I see.
What bonds?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Good.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
What do you think?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
They'll want more than your word for that.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Hello, baby.
Take it easy.
They were kidding you.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
At breakfast.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Maybe I will.
Catch me letting you go alone!
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Goodbye, darling.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
That's a fact.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Huh?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Mimi...
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
I don't know.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
You did.
Baghdad.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Oh, God.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
You just go when I say go.
Yeah.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You said he was a deserter.
He's an enemy soldier.
What if I do?
And let me guess who is.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
What are you doing?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
There might be something in there.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Oh, that's fun.
Millionaires, man.
I heard it click.
Just relax.
We're going to be right over here.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Shut up and listen!
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
We're not going to do anything.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
Is it dead?
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Sure.
Damn.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
It's got to be going better than this..
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Shi'ites, I think.
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
The...the gold...
Yeah.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What?
What!?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Then lets go back while we still can.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
What?
It's 3+27 hundred
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
What?
Why are you so concerned?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Too late....stay close.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No!....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Where's LUH?
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Yes...
Officer Reilly, vice.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Aren't you on suspension?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
I don't know. You tell me?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
You got it.
Off the scale.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
No excuses, just do it!
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
People are dying.
Stay here.
Stay in the truck.
Take him!
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
IRA - instant retirement account.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
I know.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
And diamonds in the front.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Just dull.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Um-hum ...
I hope so, too.
What do you mean?
Just as you say, Doctor.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Ah!
Certainly!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Not particularly.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Too much blue in crimson.
As you like. 
You're hired!
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Um-hum ...
Together.
Hair?
I know all your tricks.
I know it.
I <u>believe</u> you.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Call the police?
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
Yes, Madame Colet?
Yes--uh--
I know!
Please!  Thank you.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes, my bag!
The pumps --
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
What do I tell your mother?
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
It's okay. I'm alright.
This is crazy.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
I'm so cold.
That's enough.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
I'll join you later.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Baloney!
That's a date. 
We'll save you a place at our table.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Isn't that interesting?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Sure!  Excuse me.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Very much--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
Good-by!
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Sally--!
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I'll be waiting on deck.
Jimmy!
What's the matter?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Now you're talkin'!
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
<U>Me</U>!
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Get it!
Much better--thank you--
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thanks. That makes us square.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I should say not.
She did?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
So what?
She's in New York.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yeah--
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Everything O.K.?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Good-night, folks.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
About twelve hundred.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
I sincerely hope so--
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Let me look at it.
Then why did you run away?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Yes, very.  And very married.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Say when.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I'll remember you said that.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
That's great coming from you.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Awful lot of money.
What was that all about?
Good God, you're really-
Colorado's closer
How is he?
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
'Least they don't scare women.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
All right, run 'em off.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
That didn't sound like thunder.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
But she doted on the frowner
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Acquired?
I know, I need a keeper.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
We'll see about that.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Is that any way to say hello?
Is this another one of your games?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
How is old Q?
Fishing?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Interesting video tape.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Think about mom.
- You're not.
My father left me the business.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
I am. What do you want?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
What's wrong?
I see you two have met.
Approaching the first gate.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Get more men up there!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
We got the same thing.
Junior spends time with his child.
They're too big.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Will you still get the money from your father?
Why in the h...
Do you think you won?
Babe Brother.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You all act like two roosters.
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
It would be nice.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Why didn't you catch a plane?
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Let me get you a cup?
You must have done something to her.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
That's nice.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I already have, my dear.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Don't shout!
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Okay...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Let's let Molly open one.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
You can't!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Sorry.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Don't tell me what to do!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Yeah, right.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
Woody!  The rocket!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Heh-heh.
How 'bout three out of five?
Did I get my package in the mail?
She's sick!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
Alright!  That's it!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Nothing.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
He got it, Woody!
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Slink!  Hang on!
There's no mirror.
I did like the music.
She'll have to learn.
Is that all?
You're not so old yourself!
Let me in.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Can you move over a wee bit?
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
H'm?
It was only a mouthful!
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Nothing is left but us.
You're late for breakfast.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
I can't find Manolo.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
She asked me not to.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Yes.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
What is this, like freebase?
Have you done your homework, honey?
Then here's a little bump.
I feel good.
Who do you work for?
She ain't in on it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Depends on the state.
Yeah!
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
I don't know, sir.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
I don't know.  Something.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
What?
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Like you protected Landry?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
What do you mean?
What kind of research?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
You've stabbed me, man.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
It's where I live.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
And don't make any noise.
No, not holding hands.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
It's Iggy Pop.
Unless you get caught.
So why have you told me about it?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Sorry about last night -
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No, I'm clean.
Cheers.
Another dab?
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Lewis Gilbert.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
It wasn't that bad.
You're all hear.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
you'll need one more hit.
In that case --
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Yeah.
What?
He doubts me.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Plotting our new course.
Position, Bird of Prey?
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Oh, please.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Why?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
The emergency channel, open.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

  

He's not?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I belong here.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
You haven't told him?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Okay, okay...
You call that getting over it?
For being on to Dillinger.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
For sure...
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
Hah.
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
How about you?
Alan-One...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Do it!
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Then I owe you some thanks...
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Yeah, Dad.
Okay, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Fine.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Yes.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
I thought you moved out.
In her dreams.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
What are you talking about?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
It's certainly... dramatic.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
He needed my help.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Yes or no.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Sure, hon.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Yes.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
Helen.
His wife.
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
Ya looked through it?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
I took a cab.
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
There's nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
You didn't do nothing.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
What?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Really?
Cancoon.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Can you live with it?
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Get the fuck outta here!
Now tell him goodbye.
Good for you.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Where?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
What's to think about?
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No shit? Dick, that's great!
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
What are we gonna see?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
The police department?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Yeah?
No.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
We grew up together.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
What about him?
McTeague.
Where'd you come from?
Sure. No problem.
Uh-huh.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Rock whores.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
- Because it's good!
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Where's that?
No.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Shut up!
What's she doing?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
It's so clean.  No germs.
What?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
James, why don't we...?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
You're sure?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
More or less.
Harlin around?
Yep.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just a car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
You believe that?
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yeah, you better remember that.
It is morning.
I want my car.
Yeah, I'll try.
John--
Sheriff Potter.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I don't know your real name.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
Thank you.
Like you.
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
From?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I wanted to talk.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Don't yell at me!
There has to be!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Where are you going?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Give him the money.
But you said we could be together.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Grace!
I'll get it.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
John Stewart.
Wait a second--
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would I what?
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
And what does that make you?
How do you put a price on murder?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
She's dead.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
Will you shut up!
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
A hundred-forty-five really.
Not as bad as it looks.
Sure, Sheriff.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
No!
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Christ!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Who's cursed?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Who the hell are you?
Yeah...
Accident.
Bobby Cooper.
Like you don't know.
Would I what?
I was hoping we could talk.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
You came to take my wife from me?
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get away from me!
Nope.  Darrell.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
You believe that?
Darrell.
Open up!
I want my car.
Eh?
No! No police.
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's Grace.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Still playing?
How do you know he's still not here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You don't have any money put away, do you?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
There is no us, remember?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Anywhere?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
Harlin's.
One way.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
What was that all about?
Oh?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
There's someone in the house.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
No that's it.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
What was that?
You've misunderstood.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
What's he look like?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
Just one--
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
I see.
That's great.
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Is that right?
No.
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
You ain't dead.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Oh.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
He admit it?
Property.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
What's your name?
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Is... is it... loaded?
Give it to him.
Did you... kill him?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Oh.
No.
Lookin' at?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Two weeks, I guess.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Well, she...
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Beats the hell out of me.
He's dead, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Thought you was followin' me.
Nothin's bent.
Yeah?
See that scrub oak yonder?
He's blind, for Chri...
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
There's more.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
Goddamnit.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
What do you care what he says?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Well, I'm sorry.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze will be most -
I shivved him.
You didn't know.
Who is he?
We want to meet him.
Tell him we'll meet.
Someplace else, then.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
I just want to hear your story.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He loved her.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Give a guy a break, huh?
Wait a minute.
I don't.
Then why didn't you help him?
I never heard of him.
I don't
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
Because he was my friend.
You think he's..?
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Yes.  It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Gruber...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
That's right.
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I...
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
You're going to settle out of court?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I understand.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Mr. Alito, please.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Missus...
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I...
What do you want?
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Yeah.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The broad has disappeared...
In New York?
Mrs...
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Yes...
The Big Boy did...?
I married into it.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
And when she goes to those places...
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Let me come in.
Your name. And --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Dinner... and what else?
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Yes.
No.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
To complete my cure.
You can't. You're afraid!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Where had you been before?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No.
I... didn't know where you lived.
What?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
I don't like them.
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
No... it's in shadow.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
Let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Yes.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What is her name?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Why?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Oh!
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Yeah.
Who?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
Nothing to tell.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Carlotta?
Bye-bye!
Oh?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Oh... this and that.
What is it, a still life?
But you said grey, sir.
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
I'm not getting a ticket.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Just giving the facts.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Watch the tone fella.
Adam! Calm down.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Don't eyeball your kids.
There's more.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Left side.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Shut up.
I'm calling the police.
You always were a jealous man.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Now?
Fine? Fine what?
You need help.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
What?
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
We missed the deadline.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
I think I forgot the tent.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Who else?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
With all my heart.
Honey I don't have the time...
I'll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Nesting?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No.
Do you love me?
But...
What money?
What does that mean?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
You did all right dad.
Go for it.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
What is it?
Yup.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
A mutant species.
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
You'd like me to kill them?
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Two.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Don't you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
Thank you, Uncle.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
You must listen to me before you go.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
What's the matter?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
Are you Jorge?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
How much do you want for him?
What's he called?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
You think he's smart?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
How do you kill it?
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
That's not true, Parker.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
It wasn't a lie.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Enjoying yourself?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Both.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
I couldn't tell you.
Duck!
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<u>Lure</u> him.

What can it hurt is they offend me.

From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
I'll play your silly game.
I have.
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?

Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Start unloading.
Coulda been a contender.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
About what?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
What are you doing here?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
What? How do you know about my father?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What makes you think you can?
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
...I can't make it tonight.
Dump it.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Break it.
Why?
You got it, G.G.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Thank you
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Who's is all this?
China
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right behind you.
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
I am.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
This fence...it's so...
Wait!  Don't go...
And then you weren't there.
Yeah.
You know where she is?
Claire.
It's fine.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
This is...
I came in from my room...
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
What?
I don't know.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
All of us.
If she was dangerous before--
Like what?
What is it?
Did he say that?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Don't.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
Mmm.
Of him I think.
More or less.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
But what if something happens?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Mmnph.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
That's...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
No.  Look!  In the window.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Harvey says he's amazing.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
What's wrong with me?
Not personally.
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
Who?
STOP IT!
What?
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
You should have tried harder.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
I want to see my mother.
I don't want it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hello...?  Who is this...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
The lamplight.  That's all.
She didn't feel them
He just went out like & light-
Like this...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
And whose houses do you design...?
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He fools around with his patients too.
Captain's orders.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Mad. for each other.
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
- a witch.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm...
No.    This is unreal...
Talking to me dear...?
Gotcha.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You bastard!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
The one on the left - definitely...
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
BRIAN...
Yes it is...
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I'm a dentist
You don't know?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Nothing could be better...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
He doesn't need to...
At 2.00...
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Yes - one please.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
What is it now?
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
We reinvented ourselves.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
So you'll think about it?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
...not the pit.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
You mean they knew who I was?
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
I'm trying to help.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
You never know around here.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Not a chance.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
But how would we pay our bills?
Like what?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
As much as possible.
Seldom? No kidding?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Really? You'd do that for me?
You think we should be more open minded?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I... You know... I...
Thanks.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Suzie?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Lombardo's settlement?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
Where's this coming from?
What about witnesses?
And what do they say?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Just tell us what happened.
What?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Curiosity, I guess.
Whichever one I want.
Where, the mall?
I won't.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Hello.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I did.  At Blue Balls.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
That's right.  That was his name.
The one you bought at school.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
That's right.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Are you mad at me?
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Shit. Here we go again.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
I'm going to hit you.
What way is that?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Oh, thank you.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
In the next two minutes?
I'm sure we will.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I don't like to lose, either.
I've had some practice.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
That'll be all, boys.
Nicely said, sir.
And?
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
It is?
They're coming.
Just get me some horses.
No.  I mean yes.
Why not?
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I hate this.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I won't.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
That's all I ever wanted!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Shhhhh!
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Surrender!!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
They're Amish.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Yeah.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Home.
What?
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Oh. The bullets.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
But... You may not be well enough.
There was.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
That's your way, not mine.
I didn't even know about it.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Wrong.
I admit I don't know where he is.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
I don't know where he is.
You didn't have to...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I have committed no sin.
You are acting like one!
I have to help him!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
All right, where is he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
Ohhh!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Has it poppies on the wall....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
I knew you would!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
Yes --- there.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah --
Somebody pulled my tail.
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, sir!
We do.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Help!
So who are you?
Elektra King.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
But what if...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
Renard.
The worm on the hook again.
The inside man?
Who did you get it from?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
You knew him well?
It’s the only way out...
No. You’ll be safe here.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
I think you do.
He used your exact words.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
Please.
Is it?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
God isn't there to do it.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What is it?  How does it work?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
His . . . whatever.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Memory lane.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
That's because --
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Coward.  Giving up.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
Am I free to go?
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Ever see one of these before?
Looks like a diner.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Is that a fact?
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
He gets to be the hero.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
When can I see you again?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
I'm through, Xander.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Of course.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
... until he found tungsten.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Its core?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What if I like the pain?
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
To find Rogue.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I'll go.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
The way what is going to be?
I know.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Well... yes.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Whatever makes you happy.
Goodbye, darling.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
It seems fine.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
This is the only library I know of.
Will there be anything else?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
My father was a sick man.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
No, Fred ereck.
You must be Igor.
How do you do?
I wonder what's got into them?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Was he any good?
If you like -- just hurry!
What?
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Who are you talking to?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I see what you mean.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
