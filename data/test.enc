Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Why?
There.
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
They do to!
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
That I'm used to.
Why not?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
He's pretty!
What 're you talking about?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
I just upped my price
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
What'd he say?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
You're not okay.
Why 're you doing this?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Who?
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
So what's your excuse?
Yes
Is that a request or a command?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's just something I had.  You know
Wait I...
As a parent, that's my right
Which parts?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You were right. She's still pissed.
You're completely demented.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
Father Marchena!
All of them!  Just lies!
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
...delusions and paranoia.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
No!  Nothing happened.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Any I.D.?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Who's there?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
No.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
You know what that is, right?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I don't have a girlfriend.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So...who's Nicky?
I kill someone famous.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Hey, honey.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Thank you.
How old are your kids?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Give me the address!!
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Two weeks.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
We spent it!
Isn't he a little moody?
I know.
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah?  What kind?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

Okay. 
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
Good morning. How's it going?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

I'm having a party tomorrow.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true
I understand.
Roger.
Name?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I'm candy...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Hello, again.
You lying son of a bitch...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah?
No way to start a partnership.
Luther was part of the gang?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
We eat when I say we eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Well?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
There.
Let's go.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Notice something funny about that bus?
You okay?
Thanks.
What the bell happened?
How did they get away?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Who are all these?
You look awful.
Doesn't look like it.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
Hey, you're right.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
You're impossible...
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Who are you?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Leeloo's in trouble?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
At least, the cat comes back.
...Priest...
The Fifth Element...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
I'm sorry..
Six to the left. One to the right.
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
...Shit!
Apipoulai!
Apipoulai!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
...Like love...
This is all that survived?
This thing solid?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Welcome home.
I'm not accusing you...
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
You said something about money.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What's he talking about?
Don't ask questions.
How much did he pay you?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Do it.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
He's lying.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
What about me?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Hello... ?
Yes... ?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
I remember.  You just left...
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Alice, you think you can leave?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
I'm sorry honey, but...
I'll tell you later.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
There you go.  Love you.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
How was the meeting?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Reef!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
You hear that?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
What's the running time?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Safety on?
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
You know.
No what?
Jesus, why?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You and Mel Gordon?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
See. Get your boots.
Good. Who?
Call me.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
Rolfe.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Call it what you want.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
How you doing, sweetie?
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
How we doing, Colonel?
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
But they start executing hostages in
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Leave my daughter alone.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Twenty minutes?
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
May I speak to you for a moment?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
who can I say is calling?
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Thank you for calling the white House...
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
What?
Did you feel that?
Oveur.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine.
Elaine, we have to go back.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
Are you afraid?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Roger.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you want to talk about it.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine!
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
What is this?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Who is he?
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What is this?!
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
That where Anderson worked?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
What kind of test?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Could it be intelligent?
Is she...?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Well you're not reading it right!
Locked.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
No, it's different, honey.
Burke!  Open the door!
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I told you...
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
What's that?
Oh!
What did you think of the music?
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
No! No! No!
Why not?
That's stupid.
No, I'm not playing this game.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No. Don't answer it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Go back to bed.
It is miraculous.
What are you doing here?
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Be careful!
Behold!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Really?
A-flat, Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Majesty!
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Pupils?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
What medicine?
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
I'm afraid I am.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Mio caro Adone.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Did my work please you?
I have come to commission work from you.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
I do.
Are you ill?
What?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Where did I stop?
Yes.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Are they?
Where?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Is it true?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
What?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
What exactly did he call out?
Did he say a wolf?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Mr. Kessler?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
What do you dream about?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Yes, go on.
That's easy enough.
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I was dreaming again?
Bathroom.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Feeling better?
How are we feeling tonight?
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
There were witnesses?
Yes.
I really don't know.
Jack.
Okay.
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Did you hear that?
Could be a lot of things.
A coyote.
No, but he was on the moors.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Thanks a lot.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I'm going completely crazy.
What?!
I'm not listening!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
What are you doing here?
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Get out of here, Jack!
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What can we do to assist you?
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Let me have ten bucks?
Whose death?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Fifty thousand dollars!
That don't do us any good.
What do you mean?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No.
What's this?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Much better this morning, thank you.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Good morning.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Good morning, Helen.
Oh!
Helen!
Mr. Dickson?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Well, I—
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Yes, sir.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Well . . . ?
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
He was in the bank yesterday.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
How are you fixed?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
You can ride like that?
This is healing?
He's smiling.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
This is the best score yet.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I ain't done --
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Damn!
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
It's not a bank.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Where'd you get all these riders?
Cannon or Gatling?
Jesse.
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
Then why can't I go in there?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
What the --
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
That would have made an impression.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Zee.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Did you order our houses burned down?
Was it worth it?
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Now let's have a drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
There's only four of them...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Really!
Your men knew the risks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
This is him.
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
So he's won.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Dorsia's nice.
Are we here?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out.
It's a plain end, see? So?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
I haven't seen you around here.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
But what about the past? Our past?
No, no, no.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Where are you going?
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
Don't come back.
Carnes? Wait.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It looks so soft.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Oh, something. . romantic?
What is it?
Who?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Yes, Patrick?
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
A model? An actor?
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Coffee?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Understandable.  Lime?
Do you feel that way?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
What?
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Hey, Halberstam?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
I'm just screwed.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
That took some fun out of --
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
They hack into people's programs?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Great!
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
What?!
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Milo? I'm Danny.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Milo. What's up?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, hi.
You could've handwritten it.
Longitude 109 --
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
You know mine.
Cool!
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
I snuck into #21.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Oh, and Austin...
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
My meat and two veg.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Really, Austin!
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Austin, what's your point?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I love you, Austin.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
Noooooooooooooo!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Quite impressive.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Hi.
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
What did you say?
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Umm, that also has already happened.
What about his teeth?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
You
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
People, too.
How curious ...
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Then what's stopping you?
Choices?
Steed, we really must be --
But why? What's the point?
And I suppose you're the knight.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Not quite. This is my field.
Was I?
And do you trust me?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
You're playing games.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Amnesia?
No, please! I beg you ...
Rules are made to be broken.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Does Cole know about this?
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
All right!
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
I love that car.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Nice shot.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Are you okay?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Why is Cole here?
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Feel free.
The end.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where'd she go?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
How'd it go?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Wash it to the windows?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
In the Field Museum once.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You okay?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Brian.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Did I say thanks?
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Four months?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
So, you surviving without me?
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
He just wants to --
Where's Sean?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
I treated you better.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Who's this?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
-- Burn them.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
People.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Well you did.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
We're ready when you are.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Please, have a seat.
I'm out.
So that's what you been doing?
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
How different?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I won't do it anymore.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
This has to be a big mistake.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
So what's up with you?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You okay?
What is your problem?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Why'd you do that?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
Regardless, he still is your father.
Where are you from?
Finland.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I never had a really real pair before.
You sing and dance?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Money and nothing else?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...perfect...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
Oh you do, huh?
You don't read, do you?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
What is the service, sir?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
I'll match any man with the sword.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I have no luggage.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Does this assignment interest you?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
May I be quite frank with you?
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I don't know... I like the Army.
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
He said he worked there --
What business?
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Mueller.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Why?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
Full clip to the body --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Why?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Dunbar.
So what now?
We were close to something with Kendall.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What are you doing out here?
Nah.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
So?
You think he did it?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
What happens to Dunbar now?
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
What is this place?
I have to leave. Tonight.
How long have you known my father?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Did you see that woman?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Really.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
There was one time when I was eleven...
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You're not trying to run away?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
She was a witch.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You owe me three-fifty.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion, Dad?
Did I ever tell you about how...
Son?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Dad!
Tell me how it happens.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
I'm sorry.
Daffodils?
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
Oh. Oh.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm.
I need you on my side.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Say thank you.
So how long will you be in England?
You must have a visa or something...
I...
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
So what are you going to do?
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Excuse me?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't hate you.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Excuse me?
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
Have you had any before?
I'm sorry.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
Whatever.
Is the flight full?
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
I bet you have loyal customers.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Better?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Better than what you give.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
What is it?
I know that.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Thank you.
What?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
What happened to your face?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
You got any money?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Why?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Who do you think the Jap is?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This the right place?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Squid?
You cool, Ich?
Are you expecting anyone?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Why the hell not?
How'd you get this?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.  They don't want --
I'm not drunk...
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
I want to go talk to him.
It's illegal, Nick.
Nick, you can't do this.
Start it.
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
We're police officers.
Could you fill me in?
Why tell me this?
That wasn't our deal.
And what can he do for you?
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Yeah.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Well, when do you get paid?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Next.
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What shows?
It that mother real?
It's artificial?
I'd take him to the doctor.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
You use your equipment, don't you?
I told you I'd come back.
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
You know what I think?
May I ask a personal question?
What?
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Where are your folks?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
You're kidding!
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
So far?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Then forget it.
Get out!
You almost got us killed!
The what?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
I certainly do!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
I like her.
What?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Eve?!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Is that a birthday cake?!
I've got to go, now.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
Like one of Mom's?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
You're sure?
That's what everybody believes?
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
It's so small.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
And thanks for always being happy!
How old are you?
The sky?  Where?
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Elbows, Son.
Dad!
Well, where are you --
No.
Oh, my God!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You got a light, honey?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Well, put it down and come in!
How long will we have to stay down here?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
What did you wish for, Adam?
Should we say a little prayer first?
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
Yes.
We stay down here.
Yes.
He's smart.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Um... Eve?
What's that mean?
To bed?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Adam!!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
You can hit me, if you want to.
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I liked being with you last night.
Nice guy. Who's he?
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Dorothy. No!
You called me Jeffrey.
What?
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
Frank gone?
Bull.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What are you lookin' at?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
He comes over to study.
No.
Hi Dad.
Are you feeling okay?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Are you alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
So, what's next?
Yes. I do.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
OK.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
Really?
NO.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Look Jeffrey.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Up where?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
You think they sold me out? No way.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
What? What is it?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Yeah, we promise.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Promise me boys.
No. You sure you're okay?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Making Hutch David Soul?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Where are you going?
It had an alarm.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
See if mine are in there.
I'll just say it.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
What the fuck is going on here?
She's from Cuba.
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I have an idea for that.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Who's in the car?
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Mark that down.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. As a girl.
We all set?
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Where's Kumar?
Wait for Kumar.
What?
You're living on a sailboat?
Where?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
That's a sharp jacket.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
You mean like techniques?
You mean a safecracker?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Did Dignan take the test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
We're renegades from despair.
Could you grow cinnamon?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
Bob, where you going?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You OK, Bob?
Yeah.
It's in the driveway.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Where'd they come from?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That's Anthony.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
What was that all about?
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What are you doing?
Way to go, Bob!
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
How long has he been in there?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I know it's not.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
The elevator broke.
Do they let you --
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Is he in?
Oh, yeah.
We're closed, sir.
Where?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You a good pool player.
You told me Bourne was dead.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Let's talk about Conklin.
I want to know what happened.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
That's not what happened to your parents.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
You called it in?
It's just a nightmare.
Sleep. Sleep now.
But we were so careful.
That's crazy.
Where --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I love you, too.
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Why is she trying to kill me?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
You didn't answer my question.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- go -- take the van! --
You're sure?
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Believed what?
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Did you?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Let's give him half an hour.
Do we know what this says?
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Yes. In that order.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Peace?!
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Does anyone know his politics?
Longshanks promised!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Wallace has sacked York!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Stephen ready?
Rest, William.
You know it's a trap.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
We must run in different directions!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I want... to marry you!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Tonight then.
I need you so much! I love you!
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
No dances, just tell me.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Why do you ask?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
What did you see? What did it look like?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Are you stupid or what?
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
So how's Tommy?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
What's happened to you?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I just thought you should know.
There's one major hole in your story.
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
And you are...?
Smells like sex in here.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
What?
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
So you decided to go to America.
You want my advice?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I see.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Yes, I come.
I'd better be going.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
A franc for your thoughts.
Yes?
My German's a little rusty.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I didn't count the days.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
But why my name, Richard?
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
Does he always leave so early?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
What happened with Rick?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Yes.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
But we made a deal.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Even in Berlin.
You will give us the names?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
I have my orders.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
You're late.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Uh huh.
Will I see you tonight?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Hello?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Get up.
Can't.  Need water.
Thirsty.
No.
Get water!
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
It's real.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
No.  that was the last one.
How was Russia?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
"We're" not over-reacting.
There isn't any us.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
There was a coffin?
That about sums it up.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Need some help?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
How'd it go?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
And never take.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
You were how long on this?
Take your time.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
He'll need clothes... some money...
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
And that I can drive a truck!
What'd she die of?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
So, Mrs...
I've never seen a lobster.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
People watched the movies in their cars?
But you looked as if you liked it.
And what did she die of, exactly?
You don't miss it?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Stop it! Just cut it out!
Please don't make me say it again.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Is *your* father dead?
What kind of plane are you flying?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
What's that? What's it called?
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Uh... sure.
I'm not in trouble.
But you don't look very happy.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
That's *it*?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't this place look like home?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
*What* view?
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Rose Rose has runned away!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keeping the Fix happy.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
But there were other factors.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
We'll take care of it.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
So that's it...
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Come on. Harder.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Attractive girl.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Oh Jesus!
What about... The money?
He's gone.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
It's more than that.
How do you know I will?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
What about...
Why?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Is it all fugasi?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Speak.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Peace of mind.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'll take you up on that.
You're shaking.
I got scared.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
She went back to South Africa.
Good night?
How's that football story corning along?
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you trying to read my palm?
How did it go?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Really?
How did you know I was here?
Why did you take the money?
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So how are you doing, dad?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
He doesn't gamble.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
And I thought you were only after my body.
Next time it'll be my neck.
How much do you owe?
I'm sorry.
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
How are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Ross.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
What happened to Bella?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
You can start Monday week.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
The key!
The key, goddamit, the key!
What the hell?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Armed.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Hey, bomb...
Well of course I exist.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
And you can only do it once, right?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
In a second.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
I need a diameter approximation.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
We're running out of time, sir.
Sir?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Why would I be pissed?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
What are you doing here?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Where'd you clip this?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
I know.
What else can we do?
I was expecting someone else.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
How'd you find me?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I'm sorry.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Who is it?
I think you should go now.
This is not a place you wanna go.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
A little what?
Only one I can think of.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
What about this?
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Thanks, miss.
You love him?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
What's that?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Ann Arbor?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Dude, this is all I got.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
It's gone.
What do you want?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
What was his name?
Beg pardon?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Where are we going?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Donnie?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
People aren't that simple.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Know what?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Where are you going?
What's "Cellar Door"?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Because I'm so horny.
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
How much are they paying you to be here?
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
If that's what you think is necessary.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
How did this happen?
Rose.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Chut up!
Wicked.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
So, what do I say?
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Mom!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Ow!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bye mom.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
This, this... This is bullshit!
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
We was robbed.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
So help me, Gladys.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
Oh no, I can't do it.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You no gotta no gun.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you getting tired?
That's even a greater honor.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Oh, Rufus!
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Did it go well, darling?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Yes.
More romances for John?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
I found it.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I want him back!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Good! How is the patient?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Oh yes?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Alas, no.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Of course! You want out?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Thank you very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Mmmerrick.
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
...Yes potatoes... but...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Yes John?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Won't come out, eh?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Very smart indeed.
Are you the proprietor?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Well... where is he?
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What's the matter?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Would you like us to sing to you?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Really.
No. 
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
He wants to kill US!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
It's Halfdan the Black!
Let's hack her to pieces.
You talking piffle, son?
Slower! In... Out...
Look, the sky is blue...
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Row!
Weren't we supposed to?
What's the matter with them?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
It's a tradition.
So did my father and his father before him.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
There is nothing we can do...
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Thanks, guys.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Ms. Kruczynski?
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
It's okay, really.
Really? Because --
I don't have one.
I'm sure you would.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
Um --
Frost?
Thanks.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
You should stay.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
What?!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Joely...
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Joel!
I'm sure, I said.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Well, you're married.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
What do we do?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Cool.
When?
A bully? Moi?
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
What took you so long?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Yeah?
I probably got the same thing as you.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
It's them.
So then she just stops calling.
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Stan... c'mon...
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yup.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
He's coming?
Oh.
What's this?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Yeah?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
What do you believe in then?
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You don't?
Where are the others?
Tell me about it.
That's Jellybean!
What do you think?
Whose fault was that?
Thanks.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Ballast.
...do you copy?
Time to play Spam in the can.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
We have a man down...
Will it work?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
What?
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Please...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
What, Justin, what shows you?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Peters...
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
Any survivors?
No one?
It's insane.
Explanation?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Heading three-three-four...
We've got some weather.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
But...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Everybody okay?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Maybe one of the original crew?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
What?
He served on the Goliath.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
No. I saw nothing.
You got any coffee?
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
A straight line.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't.
About me? How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
I'll be watching over you.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I had it at four.
What the --!
We're working as hard as we can --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
How's the IPO?
That's good. That's uh... good.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
I can... make it work.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Any problems?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
You're a really good kisser.
Oh. Hi.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Mark. What happened to your date?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother is gonna shit.
That's him! He did it!
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
Dartmouth?!
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Are you really nineteen?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What's April 16th?
John Bonham?
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
He wanted the pineal gland.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
...and we're chock full of that!
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Why?
I want to leave fast.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
I want that fucking radio!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
Lucy.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Adrenochrome...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
You'd pay me for that?
Could I have that, please?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
What now, Geronimo?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Oh, no.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
What? Really?
My husband...
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
Four door?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
'Eh, Chief?
SHIT.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Let's move.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Let's go!
Oh my God... What is that?
Are you lying to me?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Well... come on.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
You know what I mean.
You're afraid!
Good, good. Give them that.
What's up?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Without me.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Were you a drug addict?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I know that, Dad, but --
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Name?
Age?
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Frances...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Serious, huh?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
What's left of my blood.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Evening, gorgeous.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
What a man!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Right. Except... time has a way of --
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Did you expect him to look you up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What?
I'm not!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
I don't care.
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
No!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Soon?
This was not taken from a grave.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
You dance so beautifully together.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
I've no choice
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Brother and sister no more.
No. But someday.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
Are you having me on?
Now you've got him started.
They'll hang him all the same.
You're making a scene!
You can't. Death is God's will!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I have always loved him.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
How is it you come to be here?
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Your men are right to be afraid.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Cabin B is ready.
Any particular reason?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Somebody's there, Barry.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
Roll him over!
What do you want to be when you grow up?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Are you wet?
Best over...
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
How many with you?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Twenty-eight.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Yes.
Where is the little lady?
You're a preacher?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Why are you so agitated?
What are you going to do?
What's this stuff?
It's the bitterest of pills.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
What?
Yeah, we got a bible.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
I'm really sorry.
Watch my back!
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- you got your sink --
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Not even for lunch?
Were you giving that pig signals?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
All I'm saying --
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
This isn't gonna work.
This ain't the time, Richard.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
You okay?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
That's what you think?
You know what you look like?
My shit is together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
How are you?
Of course, but there's more --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
No, sir, WHAT?
Straight up?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Should probably ask him that.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Come on, Montgomery...
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
They're more afraid of you.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
That why you dumped him?
What are you doing?
...he's pregnant.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Circuits are overloaded.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
You'd be surprised.
My life sucks.
Wish me luck!
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
God, what an ass.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Not again...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
He always has to make the big entrance.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Brandon.
How did you come to that conclusion?
No, wait, are you-
Go. They're off again.
That's It?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Covalent... Right. So...
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
You Okay, Alex?
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Oh, they're so cute.
It's... I don't know.
There's nobody here. Jason...
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Thank God. Are you okay?
What?  What did he say?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
You gotta admit, they do love him.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Wait. What did you say?
We.. We lie.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
An interstellar vox.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
"Deception..." "Lies."
A model, only as big as this.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Oh, right, sorry.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Hold course, Laredo!
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Over three hundred miles.
The army needs you.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What is this?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
You think that?
Partially...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Any word from Canada?
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
What is it, Marquis?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
Martha... what?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
But, you do come from a military family?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
What the hell are we doing?
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
They can use their imaginations.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Trade for what?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Where is my nephew?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You gave him the money?
What's this movie you're doing first?
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
That's all there is to it, huh?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Where's Karen?
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You live in Miami?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I want you to.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Part of it, yeah.
You mean, Leo?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Just a thought.
What do you get out of this?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
You mean like we don't give a shit.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Whatta you think, Chill?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It's not one of these?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Were you scared up there?
You don't act like it?
What took you so long?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
Whatta you doing out there?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Hello, Doris.
I don't have a dog.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Harry -–
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
What? You sure?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
Maureen.
Maureen.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
What the fuck -- ?
Yeah.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Could be a fishing boat.
Then why didn't they take it.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Coffee?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
You sure it wasn't me?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Couldn't sleep.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Nope.
Epps? You there?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Let the buyer beware.
I must be in the wrong business.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Never been more thirsty in my life.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
What are you trying to say?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Hmm.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
So Josh...
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Are you the one who left that note?
Yeah, right...
Yeah, well --
Shut up!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Hi, Al!
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
Are you sure?
He's insane!
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
Not really...
What? How long have you been standing there?
Where are we going?
I didn't get it either.
I totally, totally hate you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
That rules!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
So, whaddya think?
Hi.
Do you want anything?
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
Fine, and how are you?
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Oops! I dropped it!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm totally serious!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
So is that your boyfriend?
So, why did you bring this along?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
What is that?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Boo!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Just someone so young...
In what way do you mean?
What's the matter?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Yeah, well... me neither...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
I agree.
Talk to us about it...
I don't know.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Did she say that?
What do you mean?
Let me see the sick.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Pleasant journey?
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
Second death? Where?-
We need to talk.
Actually, no.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
How many do you think they've killed?
What are they looking at?
You like him, don't you?
You've known him long?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Everybody has a choice.
Oh no.
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Hello, Peter.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Or we could do that.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Who was that?
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
What happened?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Is it a star?
Ready?  What is it?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
That's too bad.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Who's the stiff?
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And may I see this storage facility?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Nervous?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Don't cross the beams.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Where's the Keymaster?
You talked to Gozer?
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
It's working!
What happened??!!!?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What is it?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
How was your date?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
You cannot die.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
You brought the army into Rome.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
You need to come home!
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Then get a large cash advance.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Are you going to graduate school?
Could you do it?
Where is the car?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
We won't. Let's go inside.
And it's all over now.
All right.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
What?
Elaine --
Where are you meeting this person?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Well, I want you to leave.
I don't understand --
Let me go.
Please let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why do you have to see him?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben.
What's that?
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Hello.
Where are you?
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
Is it a girl?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Oh my God.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
May I have a drink?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Well.
Yes?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
There isn't any.
What do you say to him?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now let's keep going here.
Well how long has this been going on.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
What?
At college.
What was your major?
Really. I want to know.
No.
I have my reasons.
What?
This is absurd.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
Oh, no.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I guess -- about my future.
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Thank you very much, sir.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Benjamin -- where are you?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Time's getting short.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
How?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I have an idea working in my head... 
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
You?
Oh!
Reducing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
I'll do anything for you.
Going?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Go away. Who are you --?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
And?
There.
Very early in the morning.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
On the train?
Then you know him?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
If we could scare up some men to play.
All right then.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
It's always so quiet here.
Hello! Hello! --
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
Oh!
Oh, I've got to find it.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
What's the matter?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Do you like me better?
What...! --
Moreover --
What is this?
You...
Skiing? 
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
I understand you perfectly.
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
Oh, no.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
No water -- What a place!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Yes --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Let us cancel the engagement.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Madam should sleep.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
It is time for the performance.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
You're discharged.
Yes, the police must be called.
Just one moment, sir.
How is the house?
I know -- I know.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Next week.
What's the matter with you?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Your what?
Motherhood.
You ever hear about the oranges?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
I certainly hope not.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Sounds like a good Idea.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
I like those.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Going somewhere?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
At what?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
You're getting off the grift?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Well, uh...
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Where's the five?
Roy?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Her job.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I've heard the name.
Is that right?
Yeah?
You -- I don't know.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
And hello to you, too.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
That's natural.
What?
Oh, Jesus.
Mr. Simms.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
I can be real stiff.
Carter.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Not me.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You look kind of cold.
It's John, isn't it?
What are you looking at?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Wait.
I have to pee.
What's this?
He do that to you?
Is Tim there?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy, I'm scared.
Mommy!!!
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
What should I do?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
Hm?
I suppose.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Months?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Excuse me.
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I wanted to apologize.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Blue soup.
Insurance!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
For Africa.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Anybody home?
Hello.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College!
College?
Excellent!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
You're supposed to get hurt!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Dad?
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Sir?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
This is crazy.
Some kind of animal?
Like hugging a lamp post.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Now that's what I call fun.
Now--turn around, if you would.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
The doctor.
He cried.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
No.
How do I load?
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
She's fine.  Please--
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
I feel the same way.  What next?
None.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I thought she was a widow.
It died for your sins.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I see.
Here.  Finish the job.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Don't shoot.
Can't do it.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
How horrible.
I'm only ten years old.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Something's made you sore.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
That's an interesting piece of news.
I don't really know.
I hate that thing.
I don't get it.
What are his symptoms?
Yeah.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
Don't worry about it.
I hate that thing.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Please--
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
He'd assume we had.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I see.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
That's been said before.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
You've got to fight from time to time.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Yeah.
I just want to ask some questions.
No, I don't.
What?
We offer...
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Are you sure it's all right?
Are you Niki?
You making a feature?
Joanne?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Are you a private detective?
You don't drink?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
What's T-J?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It's not quite the same thing.
Andy.
You are.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I don't know.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
I don't know.
The police? They know less than you do.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
What happened?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Who told you about this?
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
But I...
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
Com'on, tell me.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
To his own daughter?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Was he with a girl?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Haven't we met before?
But there is a family resemblance.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Because if you are...
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Eh, no.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You don't look eighty.
What happened?
What is it?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Oh.
Maude, I must speak to you.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
- end where I began.
It looks like you. Thanks.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
"And this too shall pass away."
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
How do you do?
Oh, is this your father?
And why is that?
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Your classmates?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Parasite!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
I knew you'd come back.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
O.K. Let's go.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
Nonsense, I...
Steve...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I need to touch it to "see"...
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Here. You'll need one of these.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Well, you did break out --
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
You want me to hold him down?
Where do you --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
You better have that looked at.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
He -- loves you.
Pardon?
What's happening?
That your daughter?
Oh.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
You remember.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Help me.
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You can't love him.
She'll tell them everything...
Don't you care?
What's the problem?
No, damn you --
It smells damp.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
What have you done?
Julia?
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Are you all right?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
Drinking alone.
You know it's not often I... you know...
Is this your place ?
Why don't you do the same?
You're awake. Good girl.
Who brought me in here?
Who's there?
You'd like the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Are you O.K.?
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I'm here.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I see.
Oh no?
I've been better.
What?
What did I say?
'Bye.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
We'll do it next Monday.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Not the point.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I wanna date a musician...
What are you snickering about?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
What's up?
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Like fuck you are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Anna.
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
'Morning, Dick.
What's this?
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
I always hated this song.
Rob.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Laura?  Are you okay?
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
What's the obvious stuff?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You won't like it.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Will you call me?
I'm sure.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Nothing.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Is Ray going?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
But you must have --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
You're the expert.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
It's not mine.
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
You have an active imagination.
Who is he?
He called you "MacLeod".
He was innocent.
What about me?
I'd rather hear yours.
No.
You're wrong.
Is this what you killed them with?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
He is older than I.
Not the same.
What is it you want?
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
What were you doing in Felton?
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Who is it?
I was driven out.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
It is as you are.
It is the truth.
Aye.
But we cannot be killed.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Something pretty.
David.
No doubt.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
What is your position?
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Spare a chair?
You've been here from the start.
Run!
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
Morning Mr. North
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Are you back?
What doing?
Who is it?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Oh, it isn't like that.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
The five hundred? Sure.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
What's the matter?
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Mr. Burns --
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Mother? But your mother --
Just for the first year.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
How's business, Bruce?
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Hildy!
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Hello, Hildy!
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What do you mean by that?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Sweeney.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
He's in the insurance business.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello -- hello...
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Walter!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Let's see the money.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I don't know --
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Hey!
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
What went off?
Where is he?
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Where's the money?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's the idea?
Why not?
Pinkus.
Get the cops, somebody.
What's your hurry?
This is going too far, young man.
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
Pauline's mum got killed.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
What's that?
Wow!
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
We don't know anything about it
What are you going to be then?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
You know it? It must be an old one.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What did he say?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It was the best time of his life.
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
I wish it could all have been different.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Molly!
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Which way?
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Thank you.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
He walks, duh.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah.
What was that?
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Don't even say it.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
God damn.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, right.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where's Bill?
Where is he?
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Plates match.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
Wydell.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Fine.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
You what?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother says he likes you, too.
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
I'm sorry about my parents.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Did you see that?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Ugnh.
Unn.
Puff, put the gun down.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Wait!
Yes.
Give me a bottle of beer.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I want to talk to you.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Could be.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
Pool.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
I never saw you do anything else.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Sign up.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
What's that supposed to mean?
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Fifty per cent?
Who's he?
The expensive kind.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Well... well, now.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Just like that?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
What's the limit?
How much are you ahead?
Try me.
How long you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
What do you do on the other days?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
For how long?
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
You name it.
That is not now, human!
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
Mine.
Humans.
You want me to stay?
Hell of a night.
You built things.
Son ... are you awake?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Is the hill ours too?
I had an awful dream.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
What do you want?
You're being paranoid.
David? How'd you get this number?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Just my luck, no ice.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Are you all right?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Not really...
A countdown to what?
Then what?
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Pops!
You still got the Olds?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Not listed, huh?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
This I can see.
Pops, you're a genius!
Any news on my wife?
That's impossible...
You can't go. Call them back.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Be careful.
Dick-weed.
Was his father stationed here?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Damn it!
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Mr. President?
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
Dad?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Look what you did!
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Where did this come from?
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
You could be more right than you know.
DONOVAN!
I'm through!
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
What's that?
At least I let you tag along.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
I never expected to see you again.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Rats?
You did!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
What?
Dad!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Marcus would agree with me.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Nice landing.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Uh-huh.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
Where's my father?
This is your last chance.
Who are you?
Charming.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
I ride with you, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
And then they took their children.
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Can you move your arm?
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
What's happening?
What about the future?
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A fulcrum release lever!
I want to go home...
So now they believe me.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Give me your hat...
No, not her. Me.
Al.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Yeah...Who?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
You weren't listening!
No they won't.
Behind us?
I want out.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
JOE Or what?
I did. I brought you back here.
Thanks.
Door's locked.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
What do we do?
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach?
Holy shit!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
Help me out, will you?
Touch her.
What happened?
It worked.
Much too blue.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
What is it, your charm?
You been had. We have.
What do I do?
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Don't touch a thing.
I can't...
What?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He hung us up dry.
Aim just in front of his face.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
What are you doing?
JOE What abilities...?
Sorry...
No!
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
Nice?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
PEM115!
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
It may have been affected.
Well...
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
You'll feel better
Al?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Sue who?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Yes...What is it?
I'll be right there.
I can't do that?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
You again.
...and sort of...disinterest.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why did you stay with me?
Who else is interested in me?
You work for Ryuji?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
This business is over.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Then why are you smiling like that?
What's Gruner like?
And Dieter.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Kiss her you fool.
It wasn't me. It was him.
What is it?
What could you find in this place?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Mom...what are you doing here?
It will.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Three hours.
When's your deadline?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Are you all right?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What does that do?
Shit...
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
I'm afraid you are.
Debbie...
Hey, Lowell.
Hi, baby.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Why?
Is there any more rice...?
Why? Who said?
What's going on?
Thank you, Bob.
Yeah.
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Area code 212-555-0199.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
So, is everything okay?
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Did I get you up?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
What do...
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
The new place? New.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Hello. You there
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Jeff...
I told the truth!
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
You greased the rails!
Where are you, anyway?
Did he hear you?
What's happening?!
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Poor communication skills.
Hello.
Is that a threat?
You threatening my family, now, too?
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Baby. You are so HOT!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
What a touching story.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
You're in a rush.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Marylin! What have I done?
What is your husband's profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Is Tong older than Ming?
How nice.
These are yours.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
How do you know?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
To victory.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Is that you?
Hmmm...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
I don't believe you have "things."
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Income tax evasion?
Pre-Castro.
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Who's that?
Forgery and Fraud?
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
You're not...
Well, that's about to change big time.
Wait. I know you.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Berry spoons.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
What ten thousand?
We'll go into that some other time.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I might.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Where are you taking me?
You only met him once .
Ellie—
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Oh, come now—
Well!
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Oh, no—no.
Are you going to see him?
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
My ticket?
Of course I do. What do you mean—
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Do you mind putting out the light?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Where is the shower?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
King—King Westley was in it.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
Carrots.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What happened?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
—six—seven—eight—nine—
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I'm hungry.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Mr. Gordon—
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Get out of here!
You're drunk.
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
What do you reckon that's for?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Yeah.
Wife?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Did he pay you for this?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
What's it look like, Nick?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
You know damn well who it is.
It leads farther than that.
...give me protection?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Then who killed the President?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
...you heard echoes.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Aren't you being a little hard?
No.
Who?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Did they live?
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
They killed him, honey.
I know David - a strange character.
Can we find her?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Are they?  Why would they?
Jim Garrison?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Can I help you?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
What's the problem?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Why were you with him?
You got a good lawyer?
What's she want?
She knows it's my case?
We are. Don't worry about it.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
I don't think so.
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
You gain weight?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Somebody loan it to you?
This is pretty.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He told me last night.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you get it out?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
"American President"
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Does it happen to all men?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You don't actually do it that way?
Has he hinted around?
You know some interesting people.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
What do you do when he comes home?
And is that it?
Where's the rest of it?
Ray wants him.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
That's Ordell's.
I didn't use you, Max.
I never lied to you.
Where're you going?
Madrid or Barcelona?
We'll just be a minute.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She didn't say.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
I'm waiting for the phone.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Jackie?
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Yeah.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's the idea.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
It's boring, isn't it?
Four years?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Which one?
Were you a disco girl?
About five years ago.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Lemme have the bag.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Couldn't talk to her?
Where's the rest of it?
Where you shot her.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
You didn't hear?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Where is it?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
Well, give it to me then.
My office.
She's been there since Thursday night.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
He's around.
Get me out of here.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Remember?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Well, try, huh.
Hey, wait!
Don't go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
You think they're connected?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
No.  I see them.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm not cold.
It's not healthy with it closed.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
They stole it.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where are you?
That help?
What do you think?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
And look what I got.
I must have been out of my head.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
What do you mean you can see?
Ready?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
You okay?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
What'd the doctor say?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
Remember that.
How come? The army?
He said you didn't have one.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
How?
Please.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
Jake, what is it?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I think I'm falling asleep.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
He's burning up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Please come quietly.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Speaking.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Still married, Jake?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Everywhere, like a plague.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Goodbye old friend.
His mother?
Minimal.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Where the hell were you?!!
Earth II.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Wait a minute...I need...
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
We need weapons.
Jesus, God!
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Pull me in!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Now what?
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
I...I don't know what I did...
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
This is what it means right here.
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I don't know...sorry?
I didn't say I was good at it.
Kay-em you okay?
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
What?
The power's back up!
I gotta go back.
I'm sending you the files.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Just a favor for your old man.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
It's three feet deep, Martin
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Who's that young man?
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Wait a minute! I need you.
What the hell?
What day is this?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Leg of lamb this time?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Follow him!
What can that gun of yours do?
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
I don't like Katrina.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
What, you mean as friends?
I try really hard, actually...
Can we make out now?
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
What is your job title, exactly?
Nails? Really?
Cool it.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Why aren't you at work?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
What...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Juno? What's going on?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Excuse me?
Hi Dad.
Please stop now.
Or...
Is this Juno?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
She answered our prayers.
What would be a good time for you?
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
What?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
That's me.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
Tight fit.
Brian.
This the book your writing?
That bad?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie... stop it.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What about you?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
...You know what I mean?
His Parole Officer.
...Diebold?
Yes. Altogether.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
She can fuck?
Oh man, that's the best.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Can you do it man?
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
That.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Right.
Shut up.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper.
Casper! Was up kid?
Where you at?
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Sup. Sup.
Hey.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Do you like kissing me?
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
What do I want to do?
Why?
Dance!
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Telly says was up.
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
I hate sucking dick!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Do you know where he went?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Not too late.
Hello?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
We seem to have a little problem here?
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
You still having a problem with this?
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
How is she?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
What is it?
Ready for round two?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Hello?
Just like who?
I'm just trying to play the game.
Have you any idea what the message is?
By that time the game will be over.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
No problem.  We're in.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
What about prints?
You mean, no prints but hers?
How long she been dead?
Well?
What do you think he did?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
He's right, Kathy.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
About what?
I can check and call you back.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Is this your first time here?
Are you with the tournament?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
We need your help.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
She died in a car accident.
What is this?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
You're right.  The killer told me.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Me too.
Lyssa ...
I will find you. I will be with you.
Colwyn ...
In the Arctic ice.
They have Lyssa!
The White Castle has fallen.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
There is no other way.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
Can she be forced?
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
You too are lonely.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Once is enough, thank you.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Where are you going?
A venison pie as big as a house.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Food for crows.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
It's a lie!
He will come for me.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
The new King.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Look.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
I was beautiful then.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
You will come with me.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
...You moved too, didn't you?
No, no.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Mathilda? May I come in?
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Risky business, isn't it?
Poor darling, and then?
...No...
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
What is it?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
The new store?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Walk with me?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
From where?
I thought you were asleep.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
It has to be a full character's name.
Are you firing me?
When are you leaving?
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
What do your friends call you?
Good morning.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
You're pretty drunk.
I sometimes fade out.
Do you want to fuck now?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
What's up?
This is the home of an angel.
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Why?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I don't understand any of that.
Thank you, Sera.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I like it here with you.
What did they look like?
How'd this happen?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
A full night on the street and this is all?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Is he always such an ass?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Come again?
Why the hell not?
You're not going up there.
Was she carrying a weapon?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
You can't even imagine.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You ready?
God, that felt great!
Good one.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
I'm her sister.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I'm a bitch.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
But maybe it's not what you think.
She's not!
How can you still believe she's innocent?
And you know this for a fact?
The what?
What the hell is that for?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
What?
I don't know --
And I fully support that.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Now I am.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Hovering?
Let's all go! Road trip!
We come watch... we come watch...
Birdies... pretty...
We watch... good fun...
You... you're a beast!
Yes?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Enough!
No... I... I need to rest.
And if I cannot?
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Worse than the battlefield.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
My God!  Look!
Certainly understandable.
I should hope not!
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
There isn't much time!
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
You promised!
Liar!
What shall we do?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My lady mocks me.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
I have no wife.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Pinching?  Where?
What's this now?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Exceeding fair.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
In every way.
What do we do now?
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Marco!
Are you going to see Sam again?
And video games after!
He's not there.
Mom?
Why?  What do you mean?
Why?
My mother would die.
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Huh?
I'm coming in.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I was wondering.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You hate your father.
I don't wanna go.
Why is that?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Oh, yes.
I hate to ask about a window.
I have the permit.
Pardon me?
Right...she married...what was he?
Oh.
Forty.
I've got one favor to ask.
I did warn you.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Because I live there.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
What are you doing?!
I don't beg.
When are you going to be back?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I'll have to pay him back.
Hi, Alyssa.
I know the feeling.
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
I gave up on you.
I would have killed him.
After everything.
I still don't know what that means.
Good for you.
I aimed high.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
Lock the door behind you.
What are you doing?
George --
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Oh...with his ear infection!
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Let's not do this, okay?
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Peter left me yesterday.
I better get the kids home.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
You never really trusted me.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
You could keep it and rent it out?
All day again?
Go tell your father we're eating.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Yeah.
Why not?
Married?
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
I got it... boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Engagement ring!
I've never seen you in here before.
That's some long green.
What?
That's right, a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
I said you're soft.
Guess we better get going, huh?
What are you talking about?
So?
This fork is filthy.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
What's up, Ray?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
I know people.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Let it go, Claude.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
What the hell are you doing?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
You got your own nightclub?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Mama?
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Appreciate it.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
We could create our own hell there.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
Hello, Cassius.
And give you a good buzz.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
How did you see me?
What is it?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Hey.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
Look who's back from the dead.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You think I'm a tourist?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
We're going to Jersey?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Yes. What is rent?
Why is that funny?
It looks like the work of a brother...
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I am.
Why?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Why did you do that??!!
Where do you live, Mary?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You prefer women?
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
What Quad do you live in?
Maybe... sure...
Why show me?
Where did you get that?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'd rather be with you.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
I -- I can't.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I'm afraid.
Don't!
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
What belongs to the people?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Are you ready to put him in?
Can you make it back?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Listen.
What's happenin'?
Pete... You okay?
Very strange.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I want more.
Can I call you?
I don't know.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
His condition? What do you mean?
Have you made any charges against him?
Where's Pete?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Who is it?
Do you remember?
What is this, Rogoff?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I won't ever tailgate.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What is it?
Where's Alice?
It must be from a real estate agent.
I called, you know.
What's that? Another tape?
So?
Where would you feel safe?
Let's go home.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I told you to stay in the car!
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Hello.
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
What's goin' on?
Last time I saw you.
Why don't you like me?
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
What about those men we met this morning?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils, huh?
Found in Asia!
Good morning, Lovey.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Where are they? Do you see them?
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, it must have taken–
He amputated his own leg?
Very often.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
What do you want?
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Oh, stop it!
Yes.
What's it mean?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
You can't take her away from here!
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
The clothes?
Good.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
What is?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
What is it?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
We'll take it from here.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Ha ha.  No, really.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
How does that help me?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So... how'd you hear about this?
What do we do?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
This it?
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
He's gone, too.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
What?
Drop some money.
Agatha...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Please, I want to go back...
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Why?
That's not much.
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
What?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Flaws.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Wally, listen to me...
Are these all of her previsions?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Rufus, play it back...
It's a little late for that.
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
Sean, wait...
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Let go of the gun.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I believe in that system...
You want to bring it down.
You said they're destroyed.
How do I even know which one has it?
Which one is that?
This is all my fault.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Congratulations, sir.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Precog Deja Vu...
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
They've never been separated before.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
I can take you down there.
Thank you very much, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
As far as...?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
What's wrong, baby?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Oh, please.
Max offered to stake me.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Get your hands off of her.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Brooklyn.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where we going?
How so?
This is it.
You bet the ponies?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
I didn't say that.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
What's the plan?
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
'Trustafarians?'
Taken care of?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Ask if he said anything to her.
Fuck them.
He implied it.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Right here's fine.
It's ours.
Who you calling?
Oh really. Why's that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
This is bullshit, man.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Let's check out the penguins.
The penguin house.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Float me a hundred bucks.
It's gonna be fine.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
How much is what?
How do you know it's not drugs?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Stop.
No shit?
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
So you're our own private guy?
Yes. You're going to New York.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Keeps me out of the army.
Did you just now con me?
How's it feel?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Little.
I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
What?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
It will be rough.
I just want to sit here and be still.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I assumed...
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Let him finish.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I better not come in.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Who the hell are they?
Yes sir.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Where are you coming from?]
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel.]
[What money?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I don't know, I swear.]
Who's he?
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
I'm here.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Did you like school, Creasy?
Not at all?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Do you think he'll come back?
It hurts.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I don't believe you.
Creasy... Wait.
Where are you?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
[You have the money.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
Yes, mom?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Our child's safety is at stake.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Creasy.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[I know this. Your point?]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
All right, I'll see you!
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Who told you that?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Oh.
It pains that they should do this.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
Yeah.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Wadda you think?
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
No...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure. This girl said...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Sure.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy!
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
What do you want me to do?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
You got directions?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Any time. Whenever we want.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Radar!
What for?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Very happily married.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
You really say the cutest things.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
O'Reilly!
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Never mind.
Did you get it, too?
Huh?
Who?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
That's good.
The Websters!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
You made it up.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Where's Connell?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Grubbel's here. See? 
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
That's got nothing to do with it!
No, I didn't write it, but—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Flowers.
Oh!
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
No shit! He's good!
Who is it?
What happened? Is there a problem?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Don't make do it, Mike.
Tell me what's wrong.
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
What?!
You signed out twice.
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
You don't have to come here.
Are you in charge, Roper?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
You think you can learn, McCall?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
To save lives.
What did you see?
He's got the girl.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
You think I didn't need you?
It's already started.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Scottie, Scottie...
Hmm?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
What have you promised them?
What do you need?
There are two million people in there with you.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
Your life that bad?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
How long?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
He had keys.
What is it?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Not his style.
An interface attendant.
Insurance?
You went to my high-school?
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Why?
What's so funny?
Voice activate.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Standard, modern, upscale --
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
Is this... food!
So how can we get to it?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
Release the power with the power.
That's pretty bad.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
That's the only way to the Monolith...
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
It's... an eagle?
I'm outta here.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
But boss, what about their parents?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
You own a hotel, sir?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Are you frightened?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
I booked passage to London.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
You fellas got names?
We'll figure out something.
How soon can we pull this off?
You're getting' 10 cc's
Come off it, Bugs.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
The terms will be mine.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
Luciano is dead?
Best we got.
Take any one ya like.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I might wake up.
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Hypnos?
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
... What are they all doing there?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Oh--yeah--
Drunks are funny--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
No.
Where?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Sam Foley--dead!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Are you ready for him, Bill?
All right, why?
He's batty!
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
What!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Where were you?
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Yes, I was--
Y-yes.
Mr. President--
Please, sir!--come with me!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Hello, Jefferson.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Whose statue is that?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Go ahead--punch.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Committee.
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
What?
Pardon?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
You mean--here?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
I know. It's--Violet.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
What are you going to do?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Where do we go from here?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
That's--that's splendid.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Order, gentlemen!
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Nice *compliment*!
Well--me, too!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
That's him. Let him in.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Good morning.
Yes.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Oh, yes.
Are you married?
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are , aren't you?
Feel better now?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Have you seen the papers?
What did you mean by that?
Yeah, I know.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Good night.
You're a fool, Babe.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
When're you going to see him again?
What's bothering you, huh?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
Come on, come on!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Gold, eh?
Come on, John. What happened?
Must we have the echo?
Look!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Will you have a cigar?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
I've got one for Cobb—
That's funny. Why is that?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
I'm Chairman?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Let him alone.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
No.
Look, he's temperamental.
Proceed.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
That ought to be fun.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Twenty! What did he do with them?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Thank you.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
What brought this on?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Althea hasn't told you?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Hello, Lionel.
Got a license?  But no car?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Ph.D., psychologist.
What'd you want?
I think you know what I mean.
Well... you see, the problem is --
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
So whose route is this?
And he's where?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is it something you've heard about me?
Hello?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Would you like another beer?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Damn! What is your name?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
"Get to know your therapist."
But look at me now...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I'm here for you, Doc.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
I never killed a priest before.
And what ritual would that be?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
And what is he in prison for?
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
So who's the broad?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Yes.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I'm not?
No... Why?... Should I?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Got guts, lady.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
She's my sister, actually.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
That looked rather painful.
We gotta get her back.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the light goes out...
Yeah.
I admire you.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Bye. 
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Oh don't start that again --
There's a big difference.
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
I'll drive.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
The who?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Roy --
So where's the art?
What's that?
Firepower costs money.
Wow.
Here you go. 
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
Hi.
Do we have to?
Where am I going?
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Who is there?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
When you eat him, may I have some?
How did it spread so quickly?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
What's your name?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
She must have been in love with you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Why did you give it to him?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
That's all I can say.
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Do you like music?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Fuck, what's his name?
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
What?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I ain't trying to get in it.
You better stop running from that girl.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
What we gonna do?
You make it sound so easy.
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I don't play for no team.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
What it say?
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Today ain't my day.
Roach, what are you doing?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
He's inside the house?
What?!  What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
Tape his mouth shut.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
William.
You too big.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Ezal!  Ezal!
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
What about that ugly dog?
My back.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
Where'd you come from?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I need your help.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
For what?
Good luck.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
What...?
He's dead?
How should I...?
I kill her - and you kill me.
How am I supposed to get away?
Come back.
But...
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
You remember me?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Who?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
You're going to go see her.
Thanks for the shine.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
It's under control.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
I'm looking for them.
Foreigners! Fuck!
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Come Back.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Where's your Mom?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Leavin', boy?
I'll light the lamp.
And the Lord told that man --
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
I tried to save her.
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
Pearl! You ain't --
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
Are we goin' home, John?
John, where's your folks?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Nothin'. 
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Are you through praying?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Worked like a charm.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
Okay?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Hello?
The killer.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Who? Who did that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Mother, for petesakes.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
I must be going nuts...
Feeling better?
And then what happened?
No.
Do you think I did it?
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
What is it, Anna?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
No, that's not him...
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
How are things in Moscow?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We may have a chance.
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
What for... why?
You, please.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Thank you.
Love to.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then you don't want me to go there.
That is correct.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
You repeat yourself.
Don't do it, please.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Glorious, analytical...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
It's nine o'clock.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
I must talk to my brothers!
Are we going to build our little house?
Our salute will be a kiss.
Radio! What is radio?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Hello, Leon!
Did you win?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
What did he say?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Make it ice cold.
You haven't seen her yet?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
She's gone, Leon.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Unfortunately.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
At Père Mathieu's.
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Is it?
Why me?
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Where's Hunt now?
Pay him.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
This is June twentieth?
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
About a dozen.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Their fourth!
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
I did?
Well, why not?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Mr. President!
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
No.
... little Bobby.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Who do you think is behind it?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
... as the old alliances crumble.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
What's in there?
Proud?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Are you okay?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Tomorrow.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
What?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Well what would you call him.
No I ain't.
Yes ma'am?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...You ride Winston.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yessir. It was punched out.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
No.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Goin' where?
So... for how long do we have to...
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
What's that.
And where is that.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I don't know.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...Me?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Will there be anything else?
Now. We close now.
...What time do you go to bed.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
What kind of tent?
Good. I need everything else.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Okay.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
What did you do?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Don't jack with me.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
A woman can write a check.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Need something else?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
You never gave us a chance...
Why do they keep calling you George?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Oh. Of course... sorry.
I have... did it sound that bad?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
Where you headed, Betty?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
She called you 'George,' George.
I got this apartment with a guy.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Rosa...
You should have a little faith in people.
What are you doing?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
What do you mean?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
I hope you're right...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Who's this?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
What'd you get her?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Huh?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Whuhh...
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
Helluva idea.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Where's your ring, honey?
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Mama said you was hit by a train!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Who's that?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I want your D.O.R.
No, sir!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
What other issue is there, Sid?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
God help you, Lynette!
What did you tell him about the baby?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
That isn't true, is it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
What the fuck is funny about this?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
What?  What do you want me to do?
You got an idea?
The hell does she want?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
NOT THAT ONE?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Where did you get this clown?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
I mean it!
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
A what?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
We're leaving.
Something's weird.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Too many stairs.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What's going on?!
Yeah.
YOU HAVE TO!
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
I'm sorry.
Why?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Tyrone...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Those ain't cops.
No...
What are you doing with the gun?
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
What are you crazy?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah, I do.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What's up with you?
You alright?
Motherfuckers...
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Excuse me?
We did.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Their names, ranks and posts?
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
And the Governor?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Did your father teach you humility?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
These four wagons must be his.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Cheraw Falls.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
No, I don't.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Don't touch him.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
How far away?
Don't worry.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Seventeen.
Put those away.
Father... I killed those men...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Ellie? What's wrong?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Nice.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Can I have another one?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
My God!
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Thank you, Louis.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
What's in your head, boy?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
I'll drop it!
You have a name, missy?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
I knew it.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
It doesn't!
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
You would do that?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Because you're a pirate.
I can get you out of here.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Tortuga?
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You haven't seen it.
How long do you leave him in there?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
... plastic.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Icky!  What's happening?
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Hey!
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Is that what Argon told you?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
What do these replicators do to people?
Susan!
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Did you go?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Susie... I...
What in the...?
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Where did you get those letters?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
You have the cutest nose I've—
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Why not?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Well, when are you quitting?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
All right, outside!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
That's a lovely dress.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
You what?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
How is her family going to feel about it?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
What do you know about Conrad?
What could I be?
Hey, Gallagher!
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
A statement? Good.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I think you'd better go.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
We just thought that—
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Stop calling me Mother!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yes.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, hi ...
What is that?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
It's six-thirty ...
Oh.  I can't.
I don't believe it.
What'll it be?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
I think I've got something to say.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
How'd you know about the fire?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Mr. Simpson ...
What are you doing?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Oh my God.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Who's that?
Can we do any better?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
So what's the point?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
What's wrong?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Can I ask you a question?
How come I'm still in black and white?
And you're sure about this?
That was sure swell ...
Hi.
So what's it like?
What's that like?
What's going on?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Where are they?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Where are you going ...
What?
I had nothing to do with that.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
There's worse places.
What's wrong?
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Aren't you a little early?
TV repair.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Hello.
Please don't.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
...yes...
Not very late.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
I know but I....how much is it?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
It was cool last night.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
Alright?
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Did you pick it up from the street?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Hi.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Where you married?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you wanna have sex?
...what...?
Yeah.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Yeah.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
The police are on their way.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
It's ok, take your time.
You want her to call you Jack?
I'll say whatever I want --
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Yeah.
It's alright.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
What is this?
Good morning, Barry....
What's up?
Hey.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Yes.
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I'll see you there.
So they'll go.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
So...did my brother call you?
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
They can't be serious.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
It's no secret that you loved her.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Who's to say I did not?
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
Abbe de Coulmier!
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I'll do everything in my power --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As you say, Doctor.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
As for the author... shoot him.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll be waiting.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Most assuredly.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
"...your wife."
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
I am eternally in your debt.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Louis
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
This picture--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
Thank you for your time
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
The great Spanish bullfighter
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Fuck you--
He'll destroy us.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's 350 pages long.
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
I'm sorry.
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Mank!
You're lying to me.
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Well it' s all you've got !
For Christ's sake, shut up--
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Oh, no--
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
Where you going at this hour?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
J.R., glad you could make it.
What's wrong?
Sure. What is it?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
How do you know? You know her that good?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
You want us to wait for you?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
I called. You weren't there.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
No, not that.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Open the door, Vickie.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
No, you're his wife.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Like disposing of their wives?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
-- until yesterday morning.
Feel a little foolish?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Jeff -- huh?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Hello.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I can't. The police have it by now.
I knew it!
That's normal.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
What about this morning? Any developments?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
What do you need money for?
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
And your stomach?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Big enough?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Make the one you want.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What is it you're looking for?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
The same.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Shut up. I'm all right.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
What's that?
Nobody chickened.
How'd he get in?
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Tell him why we moved here.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!  Shh!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
What would you do, Dad?
He depended on me.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Are you going down there?
See?  It stopped.
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
It's me!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
What?
I'm sorry.
How!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Do I have to spell it out?
Get lost.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
No--I was just--maybe--
You still pretty upset?
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this him!?
You promised me!
He wants... your "sister"...
Searching for a money man...
I've been doing good, though.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
You can't find... what?
I don't think it's negative five.
No --
No, c'mon --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Well, I don't know about that --
...the truck driver...
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
He wants to see your map.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
No, you can't --
Who are you now.
So you could get with my sister.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
What's her middle name?
What'd they call her in high school?
You knew the place --
What the fuck are you talking about.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
You gotta be kidding me.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
What about the money?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Hell you haven't.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Who, Mr. White?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
I'm sorry.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Who's your parole officer?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
You gonna put it away?
What's she doin' now?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Why?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Dead.
Want a smoke?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
I got 'em, all right?
What?
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Of course.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
You don't know how good it is to see you.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Yes, ma'am.
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Like what?
They're stragglin'.
He knows his alphabet.
Don't you trust me?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
I won't have you fighting over me.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
What was he in jail for?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Where'd they go?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Go on, hit me.
You know what she asked me?
You're not bein' quite fair.
But I want to stay.
You got no business snoopin' around --
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Even women?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
We don't want to go there.
How far up the trail?
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Would you like to learn them?
You're so nice.
Aren't we stayin'?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hello Brenda.
He's right. I should go first.
Where's Shorty?
Maybe we can study together or something.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Where the hell are we?
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
There's something I really want to share with you.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
This can't be happening?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
You could use the grade, huh?
Huh?
Oh.
Am I cool now?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
My God! Is she dead?
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
You're not wearing a belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, are you okay?
Yes.
"Ray!"
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
In here, Mom...
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Hello.
You bitch!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
State your name, please.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
What was that?
I'll give you fifty cents.
I'll take this instead.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
You scared?
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
She's a pretty good sort.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What did she want?
And that was all?
What did she want to know?
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Dr. Judd?
Would they hurt her?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I was a great dancer...
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
That was quick.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Do you have other things?
Graham is an unusual name.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, uh-huh.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
You're what?
What?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
About sex?
What about sex?
Like what?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Yes, I have. I will.
Have you fantasized about me?
Why not?
Can't.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Come on!!
You're not answering me.
I want to touch you.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
John?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
What?
Bastard...
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yes, I did.
Here it is.
It's a sun dress.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
How did you find me?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Your first sexual experience.
Do you like the way I look?
Do you think I'm pretty?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I would.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
John Millaney.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Kiss, kiss?
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
Yes? Who is there?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
I know, I know, it's just...
When do I get to see Brad?
But...how?
SIN-I-FUL
Why Janet?
Out of self comes selflessness.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Care to indulge?
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I'd forgotten.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
I'm...happy.
I want to see Brad.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
BRAD!
Our speciality.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
And none of them worked?
Why are you being so defensive?
Bye.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Are you there? Miles?
What do you think?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You got it.
You okay, Miles?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Hi.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Oh, that's tasty.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
How old's she going to be?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
This is rose, right?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Are you chewing gum?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
She what?  When?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Get the trunk.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Oh, boy.
Does she know about Saturday?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Is it the money thing?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Well?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What's it look like to you?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Me?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Look at this!
What are you drinking?
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
She got anything good?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
Yeah? Like what?
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Ken.
That was big of him.
That's great.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
A hair.
I think it's contaminated.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Hi sweetie.
You do?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
I'm not going to curse.
Explain noises.
I cursed.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Chicken Teriyaki.
It's getting stronger.
Graham.
These are D's; I need double A's.
I'm getting out now.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
It's the strangest thing Father.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
Is he okay?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Forget it.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
Kate?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Are you all right?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Jefferson City?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
I'll see you around.
Daddy?
Where is Rae?
Who?
You own this land.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
What are you talking about?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I've given that up.
You've got a legitimate job.
I took out thirteen dollars.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I thought we talked about that.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
You work here?
Nifty.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Is this a fair mix?
I've got a place I can hide her.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
-- What's wrong with that?
You're not renewing my contract.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Even the fall from the plane?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I just read somewhere --
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
What?... What did you say?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
How will you do our love scenes?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
Not like this --
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Your mother couldn't make it?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Can't you stop that?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
About you and mom?
Do I know you?
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Is it a jamming device?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer...
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
You could play the lead.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Wow. They called you their son.
Are you calling me?
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
Can I ask you then?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Dr. Crowe?
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Don't go home, okay?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Fuck you.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Are you crazy?
Should we be doing this, dude?
He means moon shining.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
How... was she "called?"
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
It's time to make amends.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Wait a minute --
You're... limping.
Get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
I almost thought for a second...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Like your guitar break.
-- Where have you two been?
Someone better tell Mac.
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
What?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Grant, where'd you go?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What are you doing?!
Where are you?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Are you nodding?
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Sure thing, killer.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Flip.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Welcome home.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
You got my barley pop?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Well?...
Driving, talking to me...
Where you from?
What the hell's going on?
See ya, Kate.
Mississippi's the other way!
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Why should I?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
Loud and clear.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Hit the brakes!
I hate to say I told you so.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit II?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Breaker. Breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Breaker. Breaker.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Oh.
Five thou.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Two of 'em?
Really?
I've got concerns.
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
About what?
That's probably him now...
FUCK YOU!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
So how we lookin'?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
-- never in a million girl --
True?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
What'd you say?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
How long can you go without sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
What will you say?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What happened?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
What happened to us, exactly?
What does Snow think you should do?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Why did she do it?
Can you sleep?
Chris --
What do I have to do to stop it?
I wish you wouldn't.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
He won't do it.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Snow, get up here, now.
Straight ahead.
I'm supposed to call in.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
He said he'd kill me.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
You asked.
Good night, Mike.
Yeah.
When can I see you?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
How long you going away for?
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I'd identify him.
Bought it.
She took you shopping for a tie?
What?
Mike, take it easy...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Who's Joey Venza?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
You in this with me?
Wasn't your fault.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
You should'a brought the girl.
What're we having?
She's what?
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
What, want a glass?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Flash, drop it--
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
You get mugged or something?
Now tell me you love me.
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Yeah--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
My my.
You should write that one down.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Peter?
Waldos.
You sure about all this?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Yeah, Roz.
Absolutely no class.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Poison emergency.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
How much do you know about it?
No…
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
They never caught on.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What some brandy?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
What is this? This is water?
You can say that again!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
You're crying, Animal.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
What are you going to do?
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Ach so!
I'll kill you for that!
We have no radio.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What guy?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Are any of them inhabited?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Left behind?
Soran?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I don't understand.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Yes.  Thank you.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Calm yourself, Bones.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Response?
Still no response, sir.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
I don't believe it...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Why?
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott...
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
See! That shimmering area.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
May I ask why...?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
Yes, I was...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Physician, heal thyself.
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
I still don't under --
... Can't read you... repeat...
... taking Genesis away from us...
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Jim --
But the child --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Well done, Commander.
Don't you believe it.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Thirty seconds...
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
She's not responding...
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
I know of your fondness for antiques.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
The prefix code?
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
A distinct possibility.
What IS working around here?
That's it?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Yes.
Reliant's command...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Cease fire. Look sharp.
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
The question is irrelevant.
Heard there was some excitement.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Bones, stay here.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
You're joking...!
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
Damage report!
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
"Neutralized?" How?
You sure you won't change your mind?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
Or believe, I'll bet.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
You tricked me.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Warp two... three...
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Bearing!
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The whales...?!
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Right on. You fly?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Deceive us?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
A perfect moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Don't you ever get tired?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Do machines ever play?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
I have to go home now.
Won't he rust?
Very funny...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Captain...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
You haven't done that in a long time...
What you're doing to my neck...
Come in.  Hi.
All hands. Battle stations!
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Isn't it better like this...?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
No... the door's too thick.
Entering the upper ionospere...
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Invasion.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
Are you alright?
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Mr. President.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Specifically of...?
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
Spoken by you?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
An INCIDENT?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Stand down your weapons.
Aye, sir.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Who is "US?"
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Where?
We HAVEN'T fired -
Captain...
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
You must have faith.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Beverly, come in.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
To new worlds...
How long until we reach the fleet?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Why am I looking at me?
You have a red shirt.
Why?
Yes.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
How can you be certain?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

Open a channel.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
What's he doing?
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
New Praetor?

I won't do it.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
What's this?
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
We need to talk, just you and I.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
What are you doing?
Yes.
I don't know.
It’s too late.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
My God...
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Intruder alert!
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Right in line with that burning tree.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Credit card.
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
That's the chance we have to take.
No deal.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Steering wheel.
Dashboard.
Closed?
Who are you?
No gas.
Who?
No.
In your pocket, please...
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Yes.
But I must go here.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Well... I'm going to go now.
You thought we were a different planet?!
Nobody knows.
Do you have music up there?
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I will go. But not you.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
What?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Oh, you're pretty...
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
There.
Where do you think you're going?
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I don't know where he is.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
You get that, Lyman?
No, sir. Radar.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I told you...
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
We can't let you do that.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Jesus.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
He has his uses too.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
What kind of things exactly?
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's been cooked-off
Whattya mean?
What stuff?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
How did you hook up with Faith?
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Commissioner Strickland.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Forget her.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
How's Zander?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
I guess.
You see Tran?
That's the original.  There are no copies.
What is that?
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
You run the plates?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You tell me.
Hey, Sheriff.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Yeah.
My God.
You're a... you're sick.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Do you think he singled you out?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
There was talk of a file photo.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
This is a sexy case.
Doesn't fit.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
You were right. He found me.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
All the same killer?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
So you went underground?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
I've been to Chicago.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I want to help you.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
No.
"MyDick?"
But why attack an Agent?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I don't think you understand.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
You have to put things in perspective.
Are you calling Her?
You should call your Grandmother.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'm Mike.
I like quiche.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
What else?
Charles! What's up, man?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Hi.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
On the table.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
I'll be around.
It's not going to well?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Lorraine?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Why?
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
Sounds more like Aids...
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Him?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Thanks, man.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Then why won't she call...?
Who threw this party, anyway?
She was cute.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
We're going to Vegas.
Wait.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
She likes you.
Nice, baby.
Baby, you did fine.
I gotta use the phone.
I just need some time...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
Tomorrow?
Is she looking at me, baby?
...we're not...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
You're money.
...Anaheim...
It's on...
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
You mean Tattaglia.
What was this for?
And this?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Barzini will move against you first.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Godfather, you understand everything.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
What is it?
I know about what you mean!
Beautiful all over, eh?
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
We should hear what they have to say.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
You really want to know?
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Will you?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Where are you going?
We're going to New Jersey?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You straightened my brother out?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
What? What?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
You know, a primer.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I have to go to Venice.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
You should watch that!
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Okay.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Very.
I found Dickie's rings.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
It's all true.
This is spectacular.
What's your secret?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
What?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
I've been backpacking.
What did he say?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Hello. What are you up to?
Was that Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
And don't forget. I have the key.
Dickie Greenleaf?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
I really don't want to see anybody.
A few days ago.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
You got a .44 Magnum?
How much for everything.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I don't know...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Huh?
The DMZ?
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Damn.
Where are you going?
Huh?
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Travis?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Just what?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Fuckin' One-Ball.
I don't remember.
Do you understand why I came here?
God, you are square.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
You don't have to.
No.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
There must be something...
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Wha -- ?
Well yes I suppose ...
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Wait.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Dad?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Whoa.
What did... what did I want to be?
Do you have the...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Now, did you remember that, or...
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
What... do you remember?
Sir, that is true.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
And... what's my name again?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Yes?
You bet.
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
What's wrong?
You smell gas?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Exactly.
Not at all.
I can play the piano?
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Ancestors?
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
How do you like our little hamlet?
San Francisco.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I don't understand.
I did.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Are you coming to my party?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Lois!
Where does he live?
Yes, but where?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
It's a surprise, you see.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes?
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
Whose side are you on?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
When do you think they'll come?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I couldn't ask you to.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, of course not.
Doesn't what make me...?
Some of them are.
I don't know you.
How?
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Ouch!
Yes.
Can't see a thing.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
Will I be seeing you again?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Without any clothes on?
So you didn't go to school together.
Why?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I'd still like to see you.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
But not for me.
I have several jobs.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Some cream?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie, Melanie...
No, no...
Where are they heading?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Have you got a pencil?
Yes, certainly. 
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
For what purpose?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
I'm cold as ice.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'll not do it, Gray.
No.
Toddy hates me.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
A pleasure to torment me?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
But where did they get those people?
Was the paralysis immediate?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
But can anything be done for her?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Crony indeed!
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
The strip joint?
Fuck! What do you want?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
Daisy. How did you know?
You killed that cop Dutton.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
No...
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
... it connects you to me...
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
You want me to walk a straight line?
Erin!
What were you yelling about?
What is it?
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Hi Mom!
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I will be in just a minute.
I wonder if we ought to--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I don't know how to thank you.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Where are you going now?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
I don't like horror comics.
Why not?
All together?
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Death to all vampires!
Don't!  Stop!
Where is she?!
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
He's not glowing.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
See you later.
Okay?
Tell them to get something to eat.
Where's Michael?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Not funny, Sam!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
-- a job.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Max... what are you talking about?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you following me?
What's your name?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I guess you're new around here.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Why not?
Huh?
It's gone.  I feel it!
Where are we going?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Go away.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Maybe dinner.
Where these tracks headed?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Let's open it.
Childs!  That a fuse?
Torch it over there!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
MacReady!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What are you doing?
Neither will we.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Hey, Sweden!!!
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Put that down!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Where were the flashlights?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
What about Childs?
You jerking off or just pissed?
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Ah... no.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Yes.  Just about here.
Do you know where they live?
Why did they built it?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
What's your name?
We make them see what we wish.
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
That was a foolish thing to do.
May I help you?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
All right, what is it now?
I know it's not a diamond but --
Let's walk through the park...
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
I know that --
I can't do that --
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Is there a lot of illness?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Is he all right?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
All of you?
I don't understand.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Yes, sir, he --
No, sir --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
You won't even try?
Sir, if I may --
We'll see about that.
Sir?
Should we be...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
He's recovering on the third floor.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
Who are you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
You done with your small talk?
This is really happening, isn't it?
But I like it I guess.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
Why?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
I've been ok.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
How?
I don't understand.
Why, what would you do?
My God you look exactly like him.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
How'd he get it?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Why not?
You told me this was how it happened.
I tried to kill my wife.
[Beat] How do you know?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Becker does? Are you sure?
Can you drive?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Well, where are you from?
Well, how'd you get here?
This is pretty good. Considering...
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
You don't think that's crazy?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
I've been better.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Oh shit.
Stop.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Did you get married real young?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Where'd y'all go?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hey, peaches.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Did you finish thinking?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Drive!  Drive away!
You think you've found your calling?
It won't work.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Louise?  Where are we?
Like a Chihuahua?
What?!
What?!  What about him?!
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
What'd I say again?
I said all that?
Louise?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
You awake?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
What?!  What d'you think?!
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Louise!
Now what?
We been seein' you all along the way.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I don't know about this, Dom.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Why's that?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Who?
Healy you dog!
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
How'd you know that?
Are you... an architect?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Miami?
Jai alai?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
You bet.
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
How many is that?
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
So who's the lucky guy?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Pat does projects all over the world.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What's up?
What...?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
The prom -- you going?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
What's that?
Sure.
Now by killer, you mean...?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Yeah? What do you want?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
It.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Is it the frank or the beans?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
No! I was pissing!
Hey.
How are you doing, Warren?
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Jesus...
My father --
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Yeah?
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
So what've we got today?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
What's that?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
I did.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Alright. Alright...
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
What did he say?
What was he saying?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
This Clear Moon's house?
You take care.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
What?
X21, give me a 20.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
It isn't?
That's a big comfort to me.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
It never came up.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
I'm different.
You don't have to kill it.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
And now I want you.
I want it understood.
Just good luck.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
One more.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
No! Not again!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
I've lost him -- where is he?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET LOST!
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I guess I owe you one.
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've seen this before.
Helping him in.
You won?!!!
It was bad.
You didn't help.
He's a good pilot.
Was going.  Now you are.
Why?
I can take care of myself.
For the same reason you are.
Where's yours?
So, where to?
Shut up and drive!
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
So, been married long?
I'm listening.
Amazing.  Where are we?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
You open it.
HER!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
On his way.
You're Kuato, right?
Yeah.
Harry, what the hell is this?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Who?
Well...What do you say?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
All right.
No options.
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Now what?
Where are you going?!
What's wrong?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I might have an idea...
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, we can take my truck then.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
You're full of shit.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
What the hell are they?
We'll take your word for it.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
You go north, I'll go south.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Use the fucking bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Down, honey, down.
Burt!  Heather!
Come on.  Get away from it!
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
And I appreciate it.
Twenty.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What's it doing?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
"We"?
You can't remember that -- !
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I embellished.
I embroidered.
A fucking wheelchair?
I haven't paid you.
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
What went down?
...I'm dying out there.
'lo, Cecil.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
CIA?
The phone company was broken up.
What color hair will she have?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Well, where are you going?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
OK, Gordon.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
What is it, Gordon?
Phillip?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
She lived alone.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
The usual, 9:15.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Call me.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
We're on our way, Baby.
You want to see...
No.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Are you sure you're okay?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Leland...
What are you doing?
Yes.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
They lied.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
How old are you?
Objection!
Mr. Concannon...?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I didn't do too well for you.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
And you wrote that...
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Thank you...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
Is this a bad time.
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Hello, I'm calling from...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
...You saw her?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Hi, Mickey...
...now who is that...?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
No.
Been a long time, huh...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...yeah... good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
What?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hey, there - open up!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's nobody left around here now.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Is that... machine...?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They've blocked it!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
So I don't know about horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
What's up?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Like Freddy.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Does he have to stay here over night?
These look quite fresh.
Someone's coming.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
Tomorrow night.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Home.
You okay, champ?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
I know how Chase really died.
Heather Langenkamp?
Studio B.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Captured?  How?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Now?
Did we lose anybody?
He would have loved this.
What?
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
But that's not the point...
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
What the hell is going on?
Ya know... "It".
So... What happened?
Where are you from any way?
Uh, huh.
What's on your mind?
Well, spit it out.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Spying?!
Son-of-a-bitch.
And being sixteen.
Me, too.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
How would you know?
It matters to me.
Why, man?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
No.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Whattaya mean family?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
You hitched yet?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
In what capacity?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
What is it, Johnnie?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You're perfect for me, too.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Sailor?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
...are followin' him around.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sailor!
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
You got me, peanut.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
How much we got left, honey?
It's a comfortin' idea.
Oh God, Sailor.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
And no AC.
You find any work?
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
Mama???
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
What do you want me to do about it?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Emily?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
James? My James? What's happened?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Crabtree.
Want some help with that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
No. There's no one here.
Vernon.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Afraid so.
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
Who?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
I just wanted a little sip.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I'm sorry.
Want a bite?
When?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Me? Sure. Why?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
You go first.
Is that Cristaile?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Not have it.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Oh?
And the jacket?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
You don't deserve me, you know.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
What is it, Grady?
Excuse me?
And?
Where you stand?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
C'mon, Walter.
It's not what you think.
They're starlings.
It's just a city park.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
How does it sound?
I'd love to hear it.
Cherry?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
You knew her?
The passionate one?
Have you seen Walter?
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
But will he... ?
Walter?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
What are you afraid will happen?
I mean, when will I be normal.
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
How do they know?
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
I don't know.
I don't know.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
To relax.
No, I am not going to --
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Who do you see?
Where?
But roughly, how old?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
What else?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Doesn't it get noisy?
I'm not easily shocked.
So... what's your dark secret?
What's the problem?
Did I say something wrong?
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Depraved? My mistake.
What was prison like?
You mean the time you're locked away?
You know, this is crazy.
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
You're scared.
You okay?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
How you guys doing?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Where are we?
I can't believe you let them do this!
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
What are you still wearing that for?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
What's the scoop, ace?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
He's got the shakes?
You owe me one, Virgil.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Did you find Wilhite?
What's the matter with you?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That's Perry.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
He's convulsing!
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Cab One, radiation readings?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
4800 feet.  It's official.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Well?
There's no comparison.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Are you feeling better?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Claudia, listen to me...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Does it please you to say such things?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
I love you.
But where did you finally end up?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please, you come too...
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
What happened?
Looks like the weather is changing.
I'll stay here also.
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
And who is this?
Where is she going?
Giulia...
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Thank you.
And how come you're up so early?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Yes.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
But she watches... she listens.
No I don't... the host is enough.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
For what?
You have a lovely voice.
Let's talk about something else.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well, who in particular?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Often?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
I went to my room.
From their heads...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like to be?
Do you have any children?
Would you like some?
You liked Sister Paul?
Why not?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
Yes?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Who am I?
And why am I here?
Of telling you.
How did you have a baby?
Why were you afraid?
Would you like to tell me?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Yes.
So I could go to him.
Stay away from me...
Not your fault...
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Larry...
I don't know.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Marie's dead Mama.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
You were a smoker?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's absurd!
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
This was before her pregnancy?
She has it now.
Not simple, no.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Visitors to the convent.
Her spiritual health.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Mary Magdelen?
Do you think they ever existed?
May I be present?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Why must he be anybody?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Somebody told her.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Too late for what?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
They're yours.
Eight and two thirds.
Yeah.
Can you fix him for me?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Sure.
Me? Why?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Sorry.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Are you pulling my leg?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
But that's not like a real person at all.
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Come on let's get this coffee.
That'll keep you busy.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
What's old got to do with it?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You are.
My eyes are lighter.
That's what you tell me.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
He belongs to Paul.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Locked.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Any rotation?
What's up?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Why, what's wrong?
Where's it coming from?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
It's over, Hunter.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We've got six hours left.
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
What?  What was that?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Recognizable!  In that?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Air lock?
This looks ancient.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
It's stopped?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
No, thank God... just missed him.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
They're on the next level up.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Here, Chaz.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Yes!
Where are you?
Now what?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
How many of them are there?
When?
Not yet.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Listen to what?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
What happened?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Okay, we're in business.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Four.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Think I spoke too soon...
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Where'd you leave them?
Jesus.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
What time?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
We're?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
She was a liar, she was a liar!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
You've already met.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
She did...?
I'll check with Eve...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
It's all over.
The audition.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
Hello, what's your name?
Why what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
- and for you.
You think?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
You don't like Eve, do you?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
Late for what?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
She's got to meet you-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Congratulations, Eve.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How much time have we?
How far to the station?
Why should he - and why should you?
That's on time for Margo.
It's just possible she didn't...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Would you, really? How sweet-
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Who's left out there?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Hello..
Call, what call?
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
"Liebestraum."
Promise.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was fine the way it was--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Hey?
--what do you think?--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Anything you've got.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Who'd you vote for?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Woodward?
You overslept?
What does it say?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
Donald Segretti?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--you got more than one source?--
Speak.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
FBI too?
You've really got to go.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
One minute but then--
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Who by?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--I'm not your source on that--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
They are not my clients.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
How grand?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
Where in government?
Where?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
But it's possible.
...go on, go on...
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Does "they" mean the White House?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
No, it was good.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Good morning gentleman.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Me too.  For the most part.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Hey, where's Finch?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Okay.
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Whatever you want.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
...excuse me?!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
You did it.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
So you need to change, right?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like how?
But you don't love me.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
What?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
What reputation?
...Guess what?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
God. How can you eat like that?
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
I know where he'll go.
Whoa...
Oh God. Shit...
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
Psychic awareness. Right.
What?
Andy...
Not you too -
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Uncle Terrence?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Where is it! Please!
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Why would he pick this one?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't you, child?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
What?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
It's her.
Hurry up with those papers.
You're a princess...
She does.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Perhaps you could convince her?
What's your name?
Hey!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Alvy, I...
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Hi. Hi, hi.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh - you're an actress.
Uh, you're driving a-
Oh, right.
Huh?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Fifteen years?
Sylvia Plath.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Fifteen years, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Really, do you think so, really?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
We can digest our-
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
Look at these guys.
You see, like you and I...
I know you've only known me a short while.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yes, it is.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
What's- It's me, open up.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Very big spider.
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
This is my room.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Tsch, a few.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Mean?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Well, sit down.
You wanna lie down?
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You fired the cleaning woman?
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
No, no, no, not at all.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
What's that?
It's going.  It's going.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
The movie.
You don't have any clothes on.
What what's about?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
I'm not.
Oh.
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
What is that thing?
Would you leave us alone right now?
Directing suits you.
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Are you my big hard hero?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
We closed.
What did you get me?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
I know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Coffee?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Joking.
Ours.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
Medallions.
How do you do, Skye?
I think there are sixteen there.
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
I don't need a drug.
Ready to go?
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I'm so sorry.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
She's all over him, are you blind?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Okay.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
We're going to have to go back out there.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Like Joe.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Of course --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
May I cut in?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Good night.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
When are you coming home?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
I don't want it.
You are?
Why not?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Thank you.
We're going to finish that gin game.
I never thought he'd do it.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Mind if I come in?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Sir?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
This?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Yeah --
I see.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
You can't come in.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
She going to be all right, Doc?
What are you going to do, Doc?
What's her name?
Any of that coffee left?
I'm not sure.
How's the patient?
What about him?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Good night?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Will you excuse me?
That's right.
I missed you, Fran.
That's enough, Fran.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Where are you headed?
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
You're out of your skull --
No -- absolutely not --
Delta ?
Rangers, eh?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
How long were you up there ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
What are we doing here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Well, get in there.
What the hell is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
You didn't like him.
What does that mean ?
Touchy.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
What do you mean?
Change.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Don't you agree?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
You've gone crazy.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
And you admired him?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
You think?
The other one --
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
What's a big question?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
What?
34   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
134  CONTINUED:
Let's go.
95   CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
What are you doing?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Thanks.
That's not what I meant.
Let's go.
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Have to get these wet things off.
I already have.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Can you walk?
I need to rent a cabin.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Go easy.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
...Ben never sent a signal.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
How was it talking to him?
I'm sorry.
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
I'm starving.
Uh, Udall?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
Getting loud, getting loud.
I can't. I work.
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
What do you want?
Boyfriend?
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Uh-huh...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You changed the room around...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Good evening.
What?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Please, just leave.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I think you gotta camp it here...
You going to come talk to me or not?
What did she say?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
How do you write women so well?
Is there a problem?
What?
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah.
What are you doing?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You can't --
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
How in the fuck do you know that?
How did he know?
Deadline?
A player?
I work for the government.
Twenty large?  That's all?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You want me to pump?
What does that mean?
Why?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need the money.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Electra.
With computers.
It looks like white's game.
He was... taken.
I killed him.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Hey, where are you?
Do you think about the game?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Really?
You should knock.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Two way?
I paid a lot for these.
Then, we wait.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Do you have ulcers?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Because, I'll take it.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Why?  I don't know.
It happened to you before?
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Four minutes.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Electra --
Was nice.
I wasn't watching television.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Do you ever think about starting over?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Can I ask you something?
Some.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
But we are underground?
You guys having a go a me or what?
Who's your friend?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'm an idiot?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Nope.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Red or white?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
What happened to Katka?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Now you're using that word.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
It's...42 56 76 .
I made a deal with Josh.
Take this exit.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
There shooting at something.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
I don't want to get in trouble.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
But we could go to London and live in England.
Forget about me Kat.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
You mean it's started?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
When the hell did you write that?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Josh!
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Come on Holly!
Why are there still such headlines?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She's coming over here...
What if they expel you?
Why not?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
A late night or an early morning?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Landon!
You.
I don't make small talk --
That's deep --
Yeah.
What the -- ?!
I'll take a chance.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
No problem --
I know. Don't say anything.
You think so.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
What is that?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
You're really into God, right?
Yeah.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
Yes. But not as a date date.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Come on.
How do you know this place?
So what do you want to see?
Why didn't you tell me?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
What are you thinking?
It's gone now.
But if you could, you would?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
This week.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
You've been well?
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
This... is the number one single?
Morning Dick.
What's N.R.C.?
Learn anything?
You remember me...?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Dad, you seen the drill?
No, Chinese food is fine.
Your line, George!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
March 11th.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Catch you later! 
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
A gold mine?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Pardon me?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What year is this?
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
How you doing, Cato?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
I mean it.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
You want to go for a ride?
Why?
You tired?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Hi.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You didn't walk out here.
Who are you?
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Not me. No way.
Then what?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Anybody we know?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Where're you goin'?
Got a casualty list?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
What's his problem?
Pictures don't lie.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I see.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well... THIS.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
...This'll sometimes help.
How d'ya like your room!
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...This must be boring you.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
It's okay, it's okay.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Why don't we go to your room-
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...I just don't know what... to do–
Yeah, but Charlie –
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Okay
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
We got a treatment on it yet?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Yes, Colonel.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Where were you tonight?
How are you, Nick?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She told you, didn't she?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
What are you doing here?
I'm De...
Did you leave the club with him?
Did you go home with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Yes, you do.
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
You like playing games, don't you?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt --
Am I... disturbing you?
I didn't.
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
You shouldn't play this game.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
You won't believe me.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
You workin' on another book?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
What kind of drugs?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Was she ever a suspect?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Catherine says you don't like her.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
You look like dogshit.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
How old was she when this happened?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
New York.
Piss painting?
Who is it?
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Would you like to see the wine list?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Blue? Where?
Who am I?
Your people.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Do you know what he's saying?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Hi.
No, I'd like the scarf.
That's a beautiful name. French?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Uh-oh!
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
We've met.
Pouring myself into my work.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Son!
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
You certainly will not.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Uncle Alfred?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
It's good to see you.
What is it?
I'm on break from-
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I was just hanging around.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Winded, old timer?
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
You're not even listening to me.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Impressive
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
You will rescue my wife
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
It'll never work.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Maybe they're right.
Master, Bruce?
What do maniacs always want?
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
Up here, Al.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
You are direct, aren't you?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
We'll talk some other -
So glad you could come.
Rinka.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
To kill me.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
He sure did.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Back off, man.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
I'll show you it works.
A-14.
A hit.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
GET IN THE CAR!!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you want a drink?
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Joker here. Can we talk?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Where does one man get all this junk?
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
And what did you say?
Do we know anything about him?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Jesus.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
Two dollars please.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What happened?!!!
Oh yes.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
Doctor Jacobson?
It is urgent, sir.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Well where is she?!
Uh... bye-bye.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Bunghole...
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Talk ta me, Bork.
You see what I see, Bork?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Do her? Huh huh.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
You got two seconds!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Anything happen while I was away?
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
That little girl saw us.
My God, we're back where we started.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
What happened?
I guess we open it.
Honey.  Let's go.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Nobody else can.
What is going on?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Aren't you dead?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
We're very unhappy.
No.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
How'd you do on the science test?
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Beetle!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
So... You're ready for me now?
He's your cousin.
Where is your mother?
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>!
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
He does...?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh, I like that very much.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
... Good night, Chauncey.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
I feel very good in here.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
No, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... How long have you been living here?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
No! He's a real gardener!
Good night.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Ben!
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
So how was it? What was he doing?
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
What about Maxine?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I need a shower.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's Elijah.
The monkey.
A better friend.
People make mistakes.
Maxine...
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Money, Miss Warts?
Security.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
No.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Moving story.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
What?
Who told you?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Hi.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Lotte, this is so good...
Let him try.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Oh, be still my heart.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Ah.
What's the play?
Is there dancing?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
You've got to be kidding.
Good-bye, Maxine.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
There ain't.
Folks came.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
MAMA!
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Till she showed herself.
You?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Leave off..
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
No, You looking good.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Fuck.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Where'd she been?
Uh-huh.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Yeah.
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Kill that poor woman.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Heh-heh--
Yes, heh--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Howdy do, Dude.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
"Johnson"?
Huh?
You mean coitus?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
She most certainly was not!
Well...yeah--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Jeffrey--
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Have it your way.  The point is--
The what?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
...Huh?
FUCK.
Walter!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
"Our" car, Walter?
Yeah.
No.
Uh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Yeah, and you were--
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
Walter, you fuck!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Dude.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Mind if I smoke a jay?
'Scuse me?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit. Walter!
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
Why?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
What was that?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Put it back in park, Blade.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
His name is Jared Nomak.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
We're locked in.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Get in. You’re leaving.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
Whistler, I --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Is something wrong, my friend?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
You shouldn't be here.
Why?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
But he's a policeman --
Graffiti --
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
What am I injecting you with?
Get out of here --
-- tearing me -- apart.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
You don't have to be.
This isn't human blood.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
That's weird --
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
LaMagra --
You're a monster.
We keep in radio contact.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Why do you hunt them?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
What happened to the power?
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Not that I can see.
Domini?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--I'm not staying here!
Yeah, so?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
So says her website.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Baby names?
--or someone--
Nothing. I dunno--
Was that you laughing?
I want to see something!
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Are you marked like this??
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
How'd you know they were--
There, what? I didn't see anything.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Boy Kurth.
Where?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Cotter--
Cotter?
<u>What</u>?
How're the cameras doing?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Let's get inside.
What--
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Why?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
Are you alright?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Okay. Hypothetically.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
....Ma'am?
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Drive me to a motel?
I could've sworn I heard something.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Hello?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's what's important.
...Who?
...You leaving?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Sure don't.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
What "what"?
Now that don't make much sense.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Yeah...
...it's too damn risky.
Don't throw that out.
Is Marty here?
Where was I?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Are you Detective Williams?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Jeffrey?
Okay?
Not yet.
Hello, daddy.
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Do you like me?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi. can I come in?
. I. uh.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Are you a bad boy?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
You. what?
Yes.
Hold me, Don.
On a ride.
What are you lookin' at?
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
What else is new?. right?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
O.K.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay. okay.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You worry about me really?
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Probably not. no. Why?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
Well.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
He comes over to study.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
This is it for me.
Nothing like this back home.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Excuse me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Why are you speaking?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I don't know...
You?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Good to see you, Diego.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Where do I put this!?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Derek Foreal.
In how long?  A week?
Mexico.
Layaway shmayaway.
Who's the cheapskate?
I want money.
George, you look terrible.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
You're like your mother.  You love money.
Hi.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
George.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Why are you smiling?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Alright.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Well, here I am.  See?
What?
What do you want from me?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
For instance, something like this?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Stoned?
So?
Smith.  Hampshire....
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
And how many are we?
It's good nobody is following us ...
But it's not even midnight yet!
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
What is she saying?
Are you ready, colonel?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
About three hours.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I've got work to do.
Tell the court about that, please.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
And how are you now?
What happened after that?
Why?
What kind of information?
What did she say?
Yes.
You'll be sorry?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
What did you prescribe for her?
High school?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Then what happened?
What happened next?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
Who told you that?
That bastard!
Yes.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Frank!
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
How?
Can we get out of here?
What do you think?
Hello?
Yeah.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
What are you going you doing?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
What are they saying?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
But Your Honor--
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I can back it up.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Really.
If you want me to.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
What's wrong?
Yes.
It's more involved than that.
Not even if they're a dork?
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
What?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Then why do you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Not this kind of heat.
Roseman Bridge?
Oh. When did you move back?
No, really?
Help cook?
Why did you stop?
Are you all right?
You really don't need anyone?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But it's not the same.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Am I interrupting anything?
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Sleep all right?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
STOP IT!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What time is it?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
About an hour ago.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Is it true?
Are you nuts?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You want us to move in here?
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
You got a nice crib here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Why?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Lucky thing.
The dead get out?
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Did you do it?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
You haven't?
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
We know how this was done, eh?
Sit down, Gino!
We're family, Caesar.
Not bad.  What for?
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
It's not here, Caesar.
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
How many'd you do?
What?  How about a drink?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
A favor?
Are they really?
Yeah.
Caesar is your husband?
Curious, maybe.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
I wanted to apologize.
How long have you been with him?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
We're not that different, Corky.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
What time did you say they would be there?
Why?
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
It's me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Done.  We go now.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
We don't know what we're into!
I'm going to Paris.
I won't ask again.
Treadstone?
I think so.
What do they want me to do?
Are you Treadstone?
So now you know.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
You are a friend of his?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
We thought you were gone for good.
I said ten thousand.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
So this is it, right?
-- just --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx

-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
... And then some.
...ixed itself.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Please, I've got to find Jill.
What's the matter?
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Jack!!
How much do you know?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
What's she done?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
So what are you going to do about her?
And you're mine.
Trust me.
Jack?... Jack?
Where do I get it stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Who are you? Let go!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
What happened to you after ...
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
A cheque.
That's it.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
What! Shit!
What?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Hey - that's my desk!
My mother said it would be all right.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Now look what you've done to him.
What do they want you or?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Es impossible.
You know each other a long time?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
What about Kanita?
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Okay, what happened?
Do you have any music?
He's very very sick.
I think this place stinks.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
Sleeping.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Promise you won't go inside.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Who's that?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I hate vodka.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Don't push it, Larry.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Shut up a second...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Yes.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
I don't like being handled.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
It's nice to see you.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Which would you prefer?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
Do you feel good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
What?
Let's go...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Just a few questions?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
But thanks.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Yes.  That's right.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Bye, sweetie.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
If we could just eat first.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I've got another story.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
It's incredible who's here.
Why can't I let go of this woman?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
What happened?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I got promoted for things like that.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Would you like to do me?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
I'm almost ready -
A girl with a body like mine?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
What the hell's going on?
Great!  What is it?
What's it called?
Look at the size of it!
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
It's true, isn't it?
Nice night out...
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Where'd ya buy that?
Yeah.
People seem to like my cat.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Well...why murdered man?
You didn't mean to what?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
I also saw the girl give you this.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I saw your...cat.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
What's all the noise in here!
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I don't think this is gold.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Nice to feel needed.
Figures.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Invite me in, Pike.
I... feel.... pretty.
Yes.
He doesn't look fifty.
What's Bobby gonna say?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Thanks.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
What are we doing?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
You look way pretty, Kim.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
Wait a minute.
All right.  What do we do now?
Here?
But you threw a knife at my head!
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
That is so cool.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Hi, guys.
So very much.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
You think so?
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, thank you very much.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
I'll tuck you in.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
No!  You're playing with my mind!
He did?
Well I guess this is it.
She's dancing with me.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Damn.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I doubt that.
Why not?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
He's a good student.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
You a God damn witch?
You missed the tag!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm going to the Show.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Sorry about last night.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Crash Davis?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
She's playing with my mind.
No.
Struck out eighteen...
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Eight and twenty-four.
It's a miracle.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What the hell's going on out there?
Ain't here.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
That's right.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
A powerful man.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Hello.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
I'll call you right back.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Dad!
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
Hello.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
All right, fine.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Okay?
Yeah.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Back -
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
You've got to stop her.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Why not make them happy?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Any change?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Okay.
Why do you need that much?
Huh?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
You can't make me stop caring...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...under?
How serious?
So, what'd ya do with it?
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
She had the same.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I wouldn't -
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Should I let her in like - ?
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
Okay, I'll -
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
...worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
No, Sir.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Can I go in?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Hey!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Tell me.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
You know?
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Come on.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Yes.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
...all the luck in the world.
Yes, don't worry.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Don't know.
Frankie!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Since when do you talk like that?
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know it, I know it.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hi.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Are you sure?
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Women, huh?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I better go report this in...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
I loved you.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Hey, you're anti-male.
Yeah, she's okay.
Next time, call...
You turned around!
Nothing. How's your hand?
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Maybe.
Don't sneak up on me...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Are you guys all right?
Lady, don't let him do it!
You missed.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
If you know that just back off.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Nels?
Who smashed the phone?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
What do you do for a living?
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Yes sir.
It's locked.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Damned if I know.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
You, I would've noticed.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Both hands on your lap.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
We're waiting on you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And then?
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who's this?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
We're gonna get there first.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Let me talk to the lady again.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
I already called for an ambulance.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
You fucking promised.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Who?
You American?
You old-fashioned?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Would you like a drink?
He was different.
What would he think?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Drink.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Tell him it hurt --
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Kind of wish I didn't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Shouldn't be, Dil
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
Don't call me that --
Told you to stay in the hotel!
What pills?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Good-bye, Dil
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Why?
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Eddie and Tinker died.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Leave her out of this.
She's nobody. She likes me.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Perfect.
Back in a minute, Jody
You OK about that?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
This is a farce, man.
Thank you, handsome.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
What makes you think that?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What the fuck am I doing here.
I got sent.
Never.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Can't.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Oh, yeah.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to sleep now.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Why not?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
It's Charles!
What's your first name today?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I'm not fifteen.
Said what?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Or Tex?
Reggie -- open the door.
What are you doing?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
The money is unimportant.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Please keep it.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Mrs. Lampert --
Yes.
He was American?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I was, too.
No -- in my room.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Is your husband with you?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
What are you doing here?
Where did everything go?
Instant divorce you mean?
Hallo, Peter.
What your husband was mixed up in.
We're here.
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Do you know what's wrong with you?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Yes -- that's right.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Why?
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I get all your CDs.
One more time.
Hi Jody.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
What do you mean?
Ok.
No honey.
You found her?
St. Michael's.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No, you couldn't.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
Then you should go.
What do you know about my father?
Go sit next to him.
Oh nice save.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
You can't tell your parents.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
You heard about that?
You know I want to go with you.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
They're not picking me up until six.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
My dad's down there!
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Hi mom.
Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Who?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
You ok?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.

Shit!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where's Sam?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...and fair...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
All right.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Damn.

You stole this truck!

I think...
That's right.  Now,  move!

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
Shut up!
...ho!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Yeah...
He's crazy!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Come on!
Uh-oh.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
It won't even start half the time.
...truck.
 Yeah.
How wonderful for you.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.

Listen, Arlo.
Put your hand in my pants.

 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 
You got Elvis?!
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
Okay...
Oh.


...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


You, Arlo.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
...us.
Oh!
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.

We're worried...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
...without compunction.

But...
Vaughn.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...

...-ple.
Mm-hm.
...always done, Richard?
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
I can't say it's a surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
There.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Yeah?
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...




 Two pots of coffee...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...somehow. 
Hit it...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
And where are you going?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...-five.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.

The compound has to be kept cold...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Dr.  Long!
 ...miles. 
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason.  Mason!
You find yourself wearing a...
...you answer mine.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...beer.
...stole a truck under arrest.
 Talk to me.

Oh.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Then these are all new owners?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
They're calling it an accident.
Oh yes.
Too bad?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
No.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Avocado groves?
Is she all right?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Hello.
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Off the alley.
That's a filthy habit.
Yes.
Where did you get this material?
Hello, Jake.
Looking for someone.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Give you three minutes.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Would you like something to drink?
Iced tea.
That's not his apartment.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Yes... why?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
We got it. We got it, baby.
Working for the District Attorney.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
What did he say?  What did he say?
It's possible.
What does it look like?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Going somewhere?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
...where does Kyo live?
Where'd he go yesterday?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
When it comes.
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
Of course not.
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Apple core?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
But...who...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
My husband...you know him.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Let's hope they like it there.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
Hello, Brad -
I know it is, Brad -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
What's funny now?
Oh!
Where's the towel?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
You goin', Mom?
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
What do you mean by that?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I'm drunk.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Hello, Brad.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She's plastered, isn't she?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
God, isn't he great?
Can I use the bathroom?
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I'm not pregnant.
Well... kind of, sort of?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
You work in a market, all right.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Then who operated the store?
Are you open?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You're late.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Great story, isn't it?
It takes different strokes to move the world.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
All four?
How do you mean?
Yeah.
More or less.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
Vermont?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Julie Dwyer died.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You hate people.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Stop it.
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
What the fuck did you do that for?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
No way!
Really?
Then how come you got the fine?
You're happy to get a fine?
Hey, what about Veronica?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Oh for God's sake!
Go open the video store.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
I said go ahead.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
How much money did you leave up there?
I was kidding.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Oh, you think so?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Who?
Where?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I feel sick.
Thank you for being rational.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
You open?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
No way!
Is he staying here?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Really?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
You hope what feels good?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I'm not sad.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Surprise me.
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
What the hell are you doing here?!
We'll never know, will we?
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
She's tough.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Can I count as fast as I like?
That's a virtue isn't it?
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
You can stop right there.
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Excuse me?
Gabe!?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Let's be creative.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never, what?!
Thanks for holding on.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Where's the helicopter?
Have her come up.
Then where the fuck is!
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Don't use my name!
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
No names, this is an open line!
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Do you feel that way now?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
What crime did you commit.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
I wanna be sick.
Crime?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I've done my best, have I not?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Don't read it - sign it!
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
It's no big deal.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You still carrying passengers?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
What?
What?  What did you say?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
What if they're wrong?
It's nothing.
I'm in town for a short time.
I got caught up at work.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Yeah?  So?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
No.  You say you're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Got it?
Max.
What about that?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
What you mean, no?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Show up for what?
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
What, no insurance?
The man who hired me for this contract.
How long have you been a hit man?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
Max?
That's love.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
I better get going.
What's the charge?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Who are you, Jerry?
He's why you punish yourself.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
You will?
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Now what?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
I don't understand.
Did you kill my father?!
Love at first sight?
I believe you.
I love you, too.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
<u>Why you</u>?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Do you believe me?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
That you come with me.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
We've lost contact.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Dr. Arroway --
Hope there's a cartoon.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
What?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
What does it say?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What...
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Could we hear to the moon?
Could we hear God?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So who -- what -- are you?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
Why don't you come back with me?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
Greenbank?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
I flinched.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I read your book.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
But I made this arrangement --
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Gotta have kings.
Tell us about it.
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
A cold drink.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
What's the writing say?
Oh Lord!
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Man Oh Man.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
I want to die.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
The first two murders.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Who?
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
I don't want this.  What are they?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
He was in my apartment!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
I heard. Good police work.
What's wrong with him?
Absolutely.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
So what have we got?
What the hell you need her for?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
Not a lot of action here.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
That's going well, then.
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Do you find him attractive?
Have you seen his penis?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
You haven't told me where we're going.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Are we allowed to park here?
Can you drive?
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
It'll be fine.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
You did the right thing.
Will you get time off to do that?
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
Yes?   Go right ahead.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Then it's over.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
It's TV heaven.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Promise?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I love you so much.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Who?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Getting back.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Agent Hadley.
What are you doing?
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Who?
Hello?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
-- Super what?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
And?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Uh, no --
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Tonight?
What kind of business?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
This is Zero.
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
All right, knock it off.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
I will.
I've got a way with people.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
And the other car?
They don't have a wine list.
This kind.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
You lived there. You know the city.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
How's my brother?
What happened?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
No shit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
You like shoes?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
What are you doing?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What's this?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
You're back!
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Yes.
Do you think you are a real master?
Why do you want to teach me?
You're already a thief.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
Put them down.
I'm tired now.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
They forced me to marry!
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
You're welcome.
You look like a rock star without a job.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
What's goin' on, Elly?
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
...necklace... pearls...
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
That thing is poisonous.
An unexpected pleasure.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
You need help.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
About what?
Shut up.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
How are you today?
It was fine.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
Need any company?
What?
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
Am I bothering you?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what? I don't take it back.
I just came to say goodbye.
Please don't go.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Where did you find those?
Well do you like him?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
If that's what you call it.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Hi, mom.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Whoa!
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
She bought it.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Hello.
What's wrong?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Who are you calling?
That her?
Morning!
So? How'd it go last night?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Tell me all the details.
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Get off me!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
She's out.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
Did you ever make a wish?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
The Farren house
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Irena.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Did you hear the child out?
You're shouting at me.
What is it, Alice?
I thought you were with Amy.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Just you wait!
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Who are you?
But where is that?
I shall want you for always.
You'll always play with me?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
It stands so still.
Look at my ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I wasn't singing to myself.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
It got hit.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
Mommy read it to ne.
What?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Mother! You called me by name!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Good night, mother, good night.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
He hasn't said one word to me.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
I think she broke the skin.
Why would they exaggerate?
No, did you fuck him?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I know.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You don't have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Where'd you get the bike?
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
The Nielson's?
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What are they for?
What's wrong?
Uh.... hi!
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is it that funny?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
You at least owe me the truth.
Go away. I might hurt you.
Be careful!
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Here's a towel.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
He means the last that we know of.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What kind of animal?
I need something to keep me awake.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Good evening, sir.
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
It seems fine.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Who is it?
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
Which one?
What does she say?  The woman.
Bad dreams?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm sorry.  About before.
You're a liar!
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
First Lady...
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
... what?
You're fired.
Fine?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
A condition...
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Three years.
What are you gonna do?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
What do you mean by that?
They could put you in jail.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Oh my God...
What happened?
No.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car.
President vetoes works bill?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
This is wrong, Alan!
And it's proving quite effective...
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I was waiting for that jack.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
Oh... Yeah.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
How were you gonna get home?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
What?
What's wrong?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Please....shoot me.
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
This stuff really works? No shit?
NOOOOOOOOO!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
What'dya get?
Sounds boring to me.
They're townies?!
How was dinner?
Yeah.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Oh God, it's over now!
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Mr. Keating!
Yeah?  Like what?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Don't stop.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Who else was involved in this?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Where'd you find them?
It's all right, Chet.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
God, if Chet found out he'd...
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
A sweaty-toothed madman
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
All right!  What'd she say?
Where are you going?
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
Father!
Look at this.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What?
Want to come to the study group?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
And now he will?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
Neil, you're not gonna...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Put more into it!
You the Captain?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not a thief.
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Seen a lot of islands?
Self sufficient...
Looking good...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
It's okay...come on...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
She's gone...
Or maybe not.
Why don't you back off?
What the hell does that mean?
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked you?
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
It is not!
I thought that was it.
What the --!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Let's go!!!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
No, I --
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You mean...?
She's in back.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Hey, guys...
Where's it gone?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
How's the trailer?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
You're going hunting?
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
I just wait. You know?
You think about it?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Pow?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
No way. No fucking way!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Great. That's great.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
What?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
You didn't get a deer?
Where?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
The fuck I did!!!
Up a little there... What would you say?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I'm not on the force anymore.
What's this?
Mug sheets.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Sir, your limo's here.
Nobody's looking.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Good night, Wade.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Rip Van Winkle.
What's this?
Sanchez...?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
You never want to find out.
Yes.
You could always take it off.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Howdy, Jabez.
Say ... about the interest ...
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
Afraid ... of what?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Yes.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Down, Shep! Down!
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Well -- I -- I-
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
What's that you say, Son?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
You're all right, Argyle.
What's happening?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Hans.  Your Hans.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
I...have a request.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Is that him?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
This is --
Jesus, you're the man!
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Jenny?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Denmark?  Sweden?
So!  Sal is with you?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah... yeah.
You try calling the police?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
How many you got in there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
He wanted to kill me!
The girl hostages.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
You're full of shit ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Now, you -- what's your name?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
It's up to you ladies.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
I want him to think that.
To show that we're negotiating.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Sonny -
They're trying to come through the door!
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Why are you doing this?
You could give up.
Of course not ...
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
Really? Did you play in a band?
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I don't like anything else.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Ya back is got.
I own a brownstone on this block.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Don't come back, either.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Squash it.
I hope the block is still standing.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Eddie Lovell.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Innocent!
Jade, you're late.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
D, not C.
WAKE UP!
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Sweet Dick Willie.
ML?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
We both do.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Shit!  I forgot.
Tina, you're sweating.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
Whaddup.  Money?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pino, relax, will ya.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
What?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
I haven't seen you around here before.
No no no no no.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
One day they'll find a cure.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
I didn't know that.
Owww... refreshing.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Sure I do. On one condition.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Captain Rob came back?
No one knows?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Hey, it's Jessica.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Cute puppy.
Well, I'm listening now.
I... found that rock.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
She's one of a kind.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Why ith dat newth?
Well, something stinks.
I'm so close I can feel it.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
I think you did it.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
It's the big potato.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
You got the Extender?
Everything?
Oh, just like the President.
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Are you going to kill her?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
My thanks.
What's that you're saying?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
He knows.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Really?
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Bela, are you ready?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Don't you have any savings?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You really think so?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
I don't understand.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
You're a fuckin' mess.
I'm going to my mother's.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Yeah...?
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
OUR picture?
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
You look beat.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
What was that?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Those assholes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
I thought this was a group effort.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
So?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
How you doing, Ed?
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah.
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Both.
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
What?
What's going on over there?
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
I batted!
Cream rinse?
What do you want?!
Oh God, this is so weird.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
You would do this? You would actually --
I'm doing all right.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Polish acrobat.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
... Ray?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Hi, Shari.
No -- keep it.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Can I help with anything?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
El/ella -
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
So Tracy?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Exactly when?
Which door?
I don't believe you.
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Who put you up to this?
Yes, Paul?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What do you want?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
How's the left these days?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Somebody hit you?
Tell me about Patchett.
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
In the morning.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
You know him?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Was it... a rat?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
What?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
That's right.
Should I?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
More or less.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why?
Ed, I want confessions.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
L.A.P.D.
Glasses.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
How was I?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I'll take your word for it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
A sweet man.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Around.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
What kind of a question is that?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I'll pay you.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
None of your business.
That is one ugly sunrise.
Them.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
How?
Reynolds.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Baudmore Consultants.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I know, but--
Because my life is being ruined.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Did he give you anything?
Anything at all?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
You should take this seriously.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What do you mean?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
It wasn't me.
Does that hurt?
Good.
I was missing you.
Who?
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
DePinto?
Never.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
He didn't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Hey!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
I don't under--
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Some of 'em.
It's okay to use the phone.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
They're framing me.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta--
Turn yourself in.
Tell me about it.
What is it you want?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
What's your opinion?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
What?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No sir.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Actually, you sing.
What am I looking at?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
I'm impressed you can sew.
You sew very badly.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
When were you most happy?
When were you least happy?
I can still taste you.
Arabic?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Why did you hold his collar?
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Have you seen Katharine?
If I could just see some identification.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
I believe I'm rather late.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Is this you?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Who are his ghosts?
Buon' giorno.
Oh, all over.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Right.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
He's Canadian.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Darling, Peter says I could stay…
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
What are you talking about?
So he popped the pane?
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I don't want to waste your time.
I've got something...
Do you mind?
But Roki said--
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
What the hell do I do now?
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Those are my clothes.
You're late.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Got it.
That's it. We're ready.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
He wasn't.
Camera in the--
Can you see the other PIRs?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Well...What are we doing?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
You have something in mind?
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
I cannot get rid of you.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
The key to success is using the right tools.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
She's calling the shots now.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Call it an expression of trust.
See you.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Where've you been?
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Tony Marvin.
What's she doing here?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
The judge came up with a number.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
And you can't?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You think there's more?
You wanna talk about --
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Hey.  I like working with you.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
Is that what you want?
Whoa.  No shit.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You're married.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Yeah.  A real moron.
PG& -- Are you sure?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Whose number do you need?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What are you doing here?
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
That's Ed.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
Thank you.
No, I need my car --
I'm embarrassed.
Someone stole my stuff.
You're moving away?  When?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, My Lord.
He'll learn.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks his concern.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... the power?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Give me that!
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
I think we're in trouble.
What are you so grouchy about?
You, too, golden rod.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
We've got to get out of this shower.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
They're moving away.
Are you crazy!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
What are you staring at?
You look silly.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
About what?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Get out of here, Lando!
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
I'll take what's mine now.
It's a lovely outpost.
What's going on?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Someone's falling.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
A tremor!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I don't believe it.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why ...
My mind fills with so many images.
Will they die?
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
It won't get through the blockade.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
I thought he was, but he came back.
He's... near.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
She's in the green.
Where is it?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
I don't know about this thing.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
What are they?
How do we get out of here?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
At last...
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
What book is that?
A king must marry, after all.
Excalibur! Is it true?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
At your service, sir.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
Father...
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
To me? But why?
Why didn't he kill us?
It is.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
You provoke me, Merlin.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
Now you must pay me.
It's-
Hi
Dinner at the White House.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What's Burke got to do with it?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
May I ask...?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Good morning Madame.
No. No rats.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Excuse me Miss?
A man to see you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Yes. He's already here.
We'll see when we get home okay.
You've been playing with it?
Regan, why are you reading that?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Do you like films?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
You'd like that?
Did you do that?
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I'm all right.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Can you give her something?
Really?
It's possible. Possible however…
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
...look down in pity...
Miss?
Is there someone inside you?
I'm afraid.
So?
What's our friend's problem?
What's wrong with them?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Piano.
Oh my God ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
When they coming in?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
What's wrong with it?
Count it.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Your older brother.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
So you'll come out, right?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
A gust of wind killed him.
That's what we agreed.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Jack.
What are you, crazy?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Get out of here!
Oh, brother.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
November.  '71.
Day.  Wednesday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
What?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What?
What do you mean?
You don't know?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Stay off it.
Jack!
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Yeah, fine.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
The audience was a little off tonight.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
You're an hour and a half late.
How should I take it?
So?
Ready?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
I wear a seven.
Right.
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
He's right.
Great?
What'd she sing?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Hey, will you look at that?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Brought it.
Thanks.
No.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
All right.  Hold on.
And you don't?
You never sang before?
Fucking.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
He do that every year?
Can't sleep?
Nina?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Guess they're up.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Hey, bro ...
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Who is this?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
What do you mean?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Which ear was it?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
-- Castor?
Stay away from my family!
What -- what are you doing?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
They're too tight.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
You've got someone in your office.
Castor's escaped!
Commander, what are you doing here?
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You'd have to start immediately.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Hello?
Why Jack?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Take you, for instance...
No.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Is it morning yet?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
C’mon Jack...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
But what do I do?
Evelyn, right?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Jack...don’t even start...
Hello!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Thanks, Jack...
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
C’mon.
Thank you...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Are you out of your mind?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You’re moving...
You can’t go!
Mrs. Peterson.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
I want to see you again.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Are you alright?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
I'll be watching over you.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Ben, come in.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Which was?
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
What are you doing?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Yes, Alan.
Listen...the Heart.
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Doctor...
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Such as?
Doctor, what's wrong?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
What's that?
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
What happened?
How's it look?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
...Would it kill you to say something?
Unguent.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
Well, okay, it's -
Three people. In Brainerd.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
How ya doin'?
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Where you girls from?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
You know what a disparity is?
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
...Yah, okay...
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
but do you know that for sure without -
Yah, but -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Yah.
Twice.
Norstars.
I mean a parking lot.
We're good to loan in.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
You look in his citation book?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Nope.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Linda.
Oh. Oh, my.
Copy.
Hon?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Not on your feet too much?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Your mallard?
That wouldn't interest you.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Hmm?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
No, you can't die of insomnia.
It becomes an addiction.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I'll take the parasites.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
I think everything's okay here.
You... don't have to... leave.
What is this?  Who did this?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Let go of me!
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler?
How have you been?
Is this a test, sir?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
It's getting exciting now.
I mean -- for a living.
What?
Well, uh... great.
I guess so.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Insurance'll cover it.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Thank you.
What?
A nice, big cock.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Alive or dead?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
You get rid of her.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
I don't know!  Nothing!
Why do people think anything?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You have jobs.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
What are you doing?
Who is this?
Abort the plan.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
What are you doing?!
I... I don't know...
Yeah, how?
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
Six duds in a row.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Take a guess.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I tried calling last night but your father --
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
That... him?
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Remember the departure time?
Stop the car!
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Knock it off!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
I've seen worse places.
How you doing, Brewer?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Where did you find this clown?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Thanks.
I do?
Look, Co...
Where?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
You think they'll find any?
Black.  No sugar.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
Can I have my desk please.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
I... You're not going to understand this.
What?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
Parry?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
You a friend of Parry's?
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
<u>What</u>?!
Him...?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
But I gave it to you!
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
SAW WHO!!?
It's such a great song.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
What are we about to do?
No.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Well, id'n that nice.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
You like it?
What?
Just finish eating.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
Alaska.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
No substitutions.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I don't make the rules.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
What questions?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look at that.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
But what about me?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
You think I'm a fake.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
No inner feeling.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
And what about love?
Mass production is what does it.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
If you want to call it that.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Fine.
Wussup?
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So you got a girl?
A play-ya.
So what you think of me?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
They are?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I think by Twenty-two.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Yo, that's my girl.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
My friend told me she lived around here.
You live around here?
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Greetings, everyone.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Jesus.
My pleasure.
You find the source?
You're in the Records Room.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Are you serious?
Good evening.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I'm the Sufi.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Why are they after you?
That's Brazil.
We can't talk about it here.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Why don't you try suicide?
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
A .357.
Do you have a passport?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Shoot.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Damn, I thought I had that one.
I bet you do.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Who is it?
Hi.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Who.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
What is this....
I'm terrified.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
You want I set up?
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
No wonder.
Where is she?
What did you want under the bed?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
You'll have it.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
You don't know the Underhills?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
Did she tell you anything?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You're saying you need money.
So what about this watch?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
You okay?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Got those Vomit invites here...
Hey, they blew me.
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Pretty smooth, huh?
Ick.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Who cares?  I got a case.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I'm sorry...
I tried to help you...!
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
What's fine?
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
The point?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
What about Don?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Shit.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
B.O.C.A.
Well try, okay?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Are you sure it is dead?
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
Des Moines.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Who is that guy?
No, you?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Same car.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
No, I don't.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
About what?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Uh, hello?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What the hell...
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
It's really you, isn't it?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What?
On the job?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Yeah, it's me.
Are you alright"?
When?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
You all right?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
John.  John, you all right?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
I better give you my address then.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
What?
Got a minute?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
I look familiar?
Who are you?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
No more... I can't!
Who brought up this bright idea?
What're you gonna do?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
It's dark down there.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
This is too painful to look at.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Got any good ideas?
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Never should've let her play.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
...And I said, shut up!
No.  No, it's not...
What?
Why?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
You mean you had a bad dream.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Which is?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Well, let's hope not!
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Steven...
I gotta get back to work.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Wanna know how I did that?
Well?
Look, I know I treated her bad --
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
A major prick.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
I guess not.
Time to check out the waiters.
Tell me.
But I thought...
Dear Christ...
What are you doing in here?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
What a beautiful day.
Can't we at least talk about it?
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Yes...
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Can he really take us home?
What about you?
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Say it again.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Great game.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
What else?
See, Daddy.
What else?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Life is true.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You're charming the boy.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Then say it.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
What do you mean?
Why?
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes, Peter.
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
What's good?
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Is it true?
But you're his friend.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
It is the work of untouchables.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
Just an admirer...
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Do you remember much of South Africa?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
You're an extraordinary man.
Assuming we are in agreement?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
We don't have the manpower.
What are you waiting for?
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
It's about the Director.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
German.
I have to know where you come from.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
It's all right.
We can't stay here.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Is that all?
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
How are you, Jerome?
Anything I've forgotten?
What will happen to the others?
What do you think?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
Have they found our friend?
Does it have a name?
You didn't know?
You're angry--
Of course I think about it every day.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
All it takes is a long arm.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
Hello, Doc.
Feel good?
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
You go out much?
Wait... give me a minute.
I'll be okay.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
He must have.
Do you mean that?
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
How much?
No scars?
We're going to make it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
No more about Beynon.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
No, I'm not.
Suit yourself.
What do you have in mind?
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Two years.
What's the damage?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What about the brakes?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
That's not good enough.
Confidential, like.
She's nothing to do with me.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
It is. Honestly.
Do you?
Yes. I met him last year.
We went about together.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Thanks for coming.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
You all right now?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
How'd you know Albert?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What is it?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Do us a favour?
No chance of that.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Eh? Have a drink.
Scotch, please.
Not suede boots!
What's that?
What's that?
Four hundred?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
That's right?
...that's right...
The nurses?
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
You haven't talked to him.
No.
You're actually talking about this?
Yes.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why?
Do you need five grand?
I do?
He said he filed...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
You have nothing to hide.
Did they...?
Did they catch...?
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Shelly: get in the office.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Mmm.
Moss...Who told him?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
...you talk to Murray...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I will close.
Now?  Now?
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Get 'em to me!
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I...
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck her...
Harriett...
You closed 'em today?
...yes...
Glad to meet you.
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
The monthly interview...?
Rick...?
Rick...
Ricky, I...
Yes.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
Who did she call?
I don't understand.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
What's going on here?
I'm...
What...?  Say the words.
What are the police doing?
You hear what I said?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You just this morning...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
What is this, your farewell speech?
Have a good trip.
They didn't get the contracts.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Yes.
Do you like them?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
I bet you can't guess what happened?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Where's my wife?
What do you mean gone?
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Where's my brother?
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
I want it met.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Good.  Then you're staying.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Kay.
How's the baby?
His brother came to help him.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Where can we talk?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
No, I meant lose his family.
We do favors for each other...
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Trust me; do as I ask.
I know.
On the phone?
I'm talking about Italians!
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
So what did you think?
I wasn't going to try anything.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
It still hurt.  A lot.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You did not know?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You went to university?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
I liked it.  We all did.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Did you kill anyone?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
I never thought you were.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Why not?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Everybody has stories to tell.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Who's that?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
No.  It won't do.
I don't know.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I'm up.  Thanks.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Mr. Kay, sir.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Does the yardman come today?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Mr....Kay?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
A boost. A big boost ...
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Who was the job for?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You want to come along quiet?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What do you want from me?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
You mean the poor --
Donny --
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
You look good...
What are you doing back?
He's in some trouble ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Cool. So you're living up North?
I heard you were pumping gas -
You?
Shadow games ...
Having fun, Kip?
Come here --
You okay -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Take it back, Freb --
How's it going?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
I go with you --
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Unlock your button ...
You think it can be done?
Tell me...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
What happened to Sway?
How come ... ?
What do you want, shithead?
Why don't you leave him alone?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Tell him. It's okay.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Anybody!  You understand?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Henry.  Wake up.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Then you're safer in here.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Don't worry about it.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
Where'd you find such creeps?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
You want a partner?
No way! You're kiddin'!
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Stop brushin' me back!
She's sharp as a marble.
What?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
I guess so.
Jesus.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
What's up guys?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
You're in a safe place, Will.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
Get out, Will.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
I can come back.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Hello.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Yeah.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
Why there?
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
About thirty million to one.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I go places, I interact.
That's very presumptuous.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Probably not.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Yes, I do.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
What does?
How'd it go?
Why not?
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
I been there. I played my hand.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
The wrench, why?
I know.
I know.
Which one did you take, Will?
I just want you to know, Sean...
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Five minutes.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Free?
You grew up around here?
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
How many?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
When?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Will? Are you awake?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yeah.
Take care.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Lots must a died, too.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
How many men?
Women?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
What's the matter?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
How about a lift, mister?
Lookin' for a job?
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Yeah.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Yes, ma'am.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Where you going?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
But will it--hurt the baby?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Anybody ask anything?
Pa! Shh!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
How about it, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
You can have this for ten cents.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Then who *do* we shoot?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
But what does *that* prove?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
What's this?
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
It's always the little things.
Yes.
You look beautiful.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You went to school with these people.
You know where I live?
Yes.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What else? Say more.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
No deal.
There you go. I left it blank.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Well?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Enough?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
God it's great to see you.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
This is Annie MacLean.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I have a way with animals.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Son?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
You missed a button.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
What did you say?
Who's going to want me now?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Great!
What did he say?
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
No. I am a "tubab."
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I'll help you with the coffee.
What was it like?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Mixed salad.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Yeah?
Mmm. An editor.
Can you drive?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
What?
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Ta-da!
Damn!
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Yeah?
And what's he do?
Did you talk to him?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
How was school?
Talk to me.
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
That's Razor and Blade.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Oh, shit! He got me.
What the hell are you doing?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Name your stakes.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
There they are!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You look good in a dress.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Excuse me.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Good.
You're welcome.
There's a new virus in the database.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Any questions?
Hello?
You think they're going to bust us?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
You're late.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Mom, please
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Because the lights are all out.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
What?
What are you doing out here alone?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Do you?
You got your riot gun?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
How's it powered?
It's over.
Thank you.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
What's the pumpkin for?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Yes, you can.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Yes.
Fantastic. Totally.
Want a beer?
Go get me a beer.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
They could be.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Can we watch the monster movies?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
The bogyman!
Right.
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Yes, she is.
There's nothing else I can do.
I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
Yeah.
Oh!
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
It's really sad.
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Now I ca-can't remember.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No!  No...
Uh, yes!
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, thanks a lot.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Elliot!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I thought you weren't coming.
This is not an easy situation.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Why not?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Hmm?
Elliot lusts after you.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
You've been with someone!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
It was on your shirt!
Yeah.  What?
Yes, please.
Yes!
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
So how are you?
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Yeah?
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I know, I know.
Mh-hm.
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
What?  You're kidding!
Okay.
Ohh?
Ohh!
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
You treat me like a loser.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
God!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
No, the reason I ask is--
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Dad...
Why are you so upset?
A reward for what?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...<u>please</u>...
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...you...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want to get married...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How crazy is that.
What's new onna street?
...nightmare.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
<u>Do</u> it...
If you would see him monument, look around you.
You give me whatever I want...?
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
What would <u>that</u> be?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
...here's to child abuse!
Yes, I did.
..suitcase...locker...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
No. 
I know you did what you could.
You know it?
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
And you let her get away.
No, I don't get you...
I came to pay my...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
The girl could use some help.
...when I... 
What's that, Baby?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
...what?
Fine, thank you, but
...my love...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Hello....?
I know where he is.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Then tell me.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
My encounter.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
You think you're so...but you're just...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Mine!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
That would be a No.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
You stupid cunt!
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Where did you get these?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
What is this shit?
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
We killed them, didn't we?
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You know what I want, babe?
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Answer him dick!
We on tonight man?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
You two....
How was the funeral?
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Can I go now?
What does old Stew want?
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
This.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
I understand... I won't-
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Who's Allison?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
You win! Okay pull over.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You're alive...
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I thought you loved games.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
What do you want?!
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Bill, I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
I snuck in.
You never saw that picture, huh?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
I... I know that, John...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
It's not right, Gale...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This guy LaPlante won an award?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
Ticket!  What's going on?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
You test each one thoroughly?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Any particular brand?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
What happened?
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Baby, what is it?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
The cab's waiting!
Did the cleaning woman come?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Just reduced.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Are we gonna buy this house?
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
What did the thermometer say?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Even better.
I'd like that.
Really?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Lieutenant?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Anything from the bank?
Where were you last night around nine?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
To ask her to dance.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Well?
Aye?
I cannot stay.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
Huge.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
I don't know.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
On the back it has--
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
Where will you go now?
Must you fight him?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
How can that be?
You kept it?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
You get anything on Smith?
You should warn them, Sonny.
Jen?  Are you all right?
Who sent you?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
I have to tell you something --
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
You leave that gun alone!
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Louise?
She didn't answer.
Do it.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
He says that his father's hurt.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
You want me to stick around, I could --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
It's mine.  Talley.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
The kids are in here!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
Where are you right now?
I think so.
Okay.
Can you open them?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Marlon and Al....
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Paul, you know who this is?
They fired a rocket at us.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
I will see what I can do.
Where are my supplies?
Where are they going?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
You are a marked man.
I committed no war crimes.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
What do you mean George?
) You cannot kill them all.
Let’s go, Jock.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
There are no more rooms.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Do something.
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
What is it, Paul.
This won't do.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
I will not leave without the twins.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Where has all our beer gone?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Paul. Are you alright?
All. What do you mean all?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
There are soldiers.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Not yet.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Oh, for chrissake --
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
-- I did: down here.
'Less the place really is haunted.
You said that was an accident.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
What's down there?
Pritchett, is that you?
Is she...alright?
We can do it...
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Could we have a word?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Steven --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
What're you talking about?
I'll take my chances.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
Then who did??
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Don't know that it does.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Ghosts killed your father?
-- hey! --
They don't build them like this anymore.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
It looks delicious...
It will heal.
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
She's here.
She's down.  Help her...
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
But do you agree with me?
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I think we should do it.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
We'll never know for sure.
The rain is letting up.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Something bad.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
What will he do?  What does he want?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I figured I'd make breakfast.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Sure.  Why?
Joey ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Welcome. 38
Uh-huh.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Yeah right.  Look ...
Really?
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
You got about five minutes and change.
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Count of three?
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Welcome back to Vinci.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
I'm going to find out.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Oh, you read that.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Where did you get this?
I hope you know what....
Way to go, Anna.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
No, let me!
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
This is the worst night...
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoopsucker!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
About seven minutes.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
-- and she's dynamite!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Well, I --
...You know! For kids!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
You mean you know about this?
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Ya know, entry level!
How long've you been down here?
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
...It is?
Geez, I --
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...education, were you?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Finally.
I got gas, Bennie.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...No money.
He don't look wise.
Hello, Niagara.
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
Good morning, miss.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
I've never given it much thought.
I heard you playing.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You wanted to warn me...
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You want that?
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
What do you think?
You all right there?
You crying?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Don't start.
Don't be dim.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
That this was going to be a key party?
Damn it, Ben --
Classes?
Anyone special? You know...
Here.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Dad stop it!
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
I saw you on your bike today.
Mikey Williams?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Reverend Edwards.
Jesus, Jim!
Just be careful.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Maybe you should have just a half.
How do you know this shit?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Want some gum?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Wow!
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Hood residence.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Hey Wendy.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Duggar called him?
It's legitimate.
What about your shoulder?
Thanks.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
No.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
I'll call him now.
Did she?
What do you want to talk about?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
No way.
I'm not expecting anyone.
One of your cases?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Thought I smelled something.
Since grade school.
No...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
Oh?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
What the hell do you know?
Your lips, they didn't move.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
No, my beloved, my child.
But why?
Then blame the one who made her...
We want no quarrel with him.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
And if I cut my hair again?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
I want more.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
You both did it?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You know her?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
You want death? Is it death you want?
What do you want from me?
You've just done it -
You're sure?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
What have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Lestat!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
It's only a siren...
It's just a room...
Well, what a lucky break for me.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You can't look at them...
What about coffins?
But why did you tell her?
You found nothing?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Yes.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Storm season?
The number's unlisted...
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I'm the King of the World.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
Karla!
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I'm holding your hand!
Yeah.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
I love it here.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
This was not my idea.
You sure it's okay with you?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
There was a body! I swear it!
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Pretty cool bar.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Rio de Janeiro!
Well, there's some flaws in her...
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
Where is everybody?
Take this.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
I have forgotten it, dear.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
You know that sound, Oliver?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Stand back.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
Where's Mary?
I . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You sent for me, sir?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
What?
What's that?
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Got a match?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
No, George, don't . . .
I know, but . . .
Hello.
Pop!
Yes, sir.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Made up your mind yet?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Too young or too old?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
I'll take it. And then what?
How's that?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
Sure you do -- you win either way.
No.
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
What is it?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
You coming up on him?
Tina!
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
What is it?  What's there?
Chief....
Positive I.D.?
I'm going out there.
Where to?
Do I have to?
I'm going.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Look at that:
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Okay, so that's it.
And sound.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Let's get the kid home.
Eat Cheerios.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
No.
All summer?
I know what you're going to say.
What're you going to do today?
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Did you say Cable Junction?
Some people.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
How old is your cousin?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Me neither.
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Right after, the Kids went out?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
About damn time.
What's the lighthouse?
What's wrong?
He's got to help or it won't work.
Take me.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
They're coming with us?
Are you scared?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Where are you going?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Here.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Yes.  It's faster.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
Somebody better get down there!
Nobody told me.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I told you, something's upset them.
I'm sorry.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
I will.
I want that shark alive.
You look like an orange worm.
How's sleeping beauty?
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
How long you staying?
How come?
Come on, it's fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
No, South Georgia.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
What kind of trouble?
That's impossible.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Gee, it's good to see you!
She still talking to you?
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Where are you going?
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Turn it off....
You knew...?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Beginning of what?
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
I didn't mean to start that....
You could teach...You could....
You're having a good time....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
You hungry?
Promise me you'll be all right....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I'll get it back next time.
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I stuck them on, man....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Maybe I missed you too....
How many?
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Where is everybody?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long have you known Hoagie?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
I don't like the song.
You told me what?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
All the time....
I'll do it, Jake.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Be my guest. What you got?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
Not for me ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What does that mean?
There's nothing in the files?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Why?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That isn't what you said before.
Did I say he did?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Where's your watch?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
How do you know her hair's black?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
What are you reading?
Are you married?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
Just your age.
You know? How do you know?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He doesn't need my help.
Interview over, Blattis ...
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
You think he still loves her?
You think John would like it?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
She married some English prick.
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
You can drive down there, Sir ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Well, no you didn't --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Didn't hear it.
No one has ever dumped me.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Wonder what he said.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
It's all going to work.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Hey you.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Sure you're okay to drive this?
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't like to give up.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
What about medical?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
What are you doing with me, Rod?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
You're telling me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
The kid is amazing.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Not everyone has what you have.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Beautiful.
Oh, tell the story.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hi.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
You said "fuck".
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
No, Dr. Grant says...
Young adult.
That's him. That’s Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Where's Dad?
I don’t know.
Absolutely not.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
Is it a rex?
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
I CAN GET HIM!
I'd better get going.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Know what this is?
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
How do you mean?
You hear something?
Is there an antidote?
But he's the head of InGen!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Is that kid still bothering you?
Dad!
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What kind of gun is that?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
We took to the rock.
What do they want?!
What are they?
Come on!
Head for the roof!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Hold it down, Nick!
Ask her.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Constantly sick.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Do you see anything?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I'm going with you.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
Can we chance moving him?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
I read your book.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
I threw up.
I can't!  I'm scared!
Go, go, go, jump!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Yeah, they hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Well?
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
What?
A house?
Sorry.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
You watch this garbage?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
You're not going to be there?
Where's he going?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Fine -- terrible.
Just what you've published.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
-- You appreciate my writing.
Will you do me a favor then?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
Well, I --
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
What's the matter with you?
May I ask where your two warders are?
It's gone out so quickly?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
Women are all you have on your mind!
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
What have you got there?
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
It's the same image - Kong!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Man Eater!!!
Did you see her?
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
Enjoy.  Well --
Guess!
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Who?
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
He never told me.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
You said it was!
It's kind of late.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Where'd you spend last night?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Then, close the case.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Town Police.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Well?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Are you closing the case?
Does that distress you?
What do you like best about her?
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
When is mommy coming back?
When is mommy coming back?
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
Daddy?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
See.  That's my name.
What did you do when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
A heavy drinker?
I don't recall.
I don't recall.
Is that...permanent?
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
And?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
John?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
You ever think about getting married again?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
California?
Thelma, if I die--
Ted.
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Please, come, Holiness.
Mama, my story.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
I will buy them for you.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Did you receive the letter?
Me. First break of day.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
I am scared.
Please, come in, so cold.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Me?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
I do.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
I'll sue you.
Go!!!
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Jesus Christ!!
I'm laying a spring trap!
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
I can arrest you!!
He never said "go".
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
I got something on the screen.
Where is he?
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
How big do the bears get?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
You okay?  Kelly?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Well.  Goodnight.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Calm down.
He's mooing.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
No.
We set?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
If you get a safe shot...
He just came up screaming.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Yes.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
What?
You have a thing against museums?
You're sort of a rude person.
They don't believe her.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What is this?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Are you alright?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
They're coming right in.
Should I?
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
That's not what you came to say.
Hey.
This is what we do?
I'm not even a field person.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Boy, is that smart...
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Why not?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
They all were.
Go, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
No. Tell me why.
Horses - and sheep...
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
But you could. You did.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Thank you, Clarice.
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Are you alright?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Mr Poe?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Where will we go?
Some say that's the way of it.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Who were these people?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
How long?
Head for... for the white water.
Then what?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Got a reason to stay.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
What a place for them...
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Such as...?
My colors?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Was there such a thing?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
DeJesus!  A readout!
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
What's wrong with it?
Oh, God, she's out there...
Okay, number 23's full.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What happened?
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How'd you do that?
How far away is she?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What is it?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Bacon, see what we got.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
I hate these Southern shites.
JD.
Nope.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Have you counted the money?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You all right back there, mate?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
It must be this one.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
I will.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
And that does include the amp?
My van is half full.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
What's left over?'
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
You jerk--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
And what did she do?
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Out of the Army?
And you and Private Graves--
We're not running a dating service here.
Private Johnson!
Sam the Man.
That the word on our boy?
What's that for?
I'm not picking it up.
You look good--
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
I'm a colonel.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
So how come you got into all this?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I have a B average.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
We been through this before--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Senora Cruz?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
I thought you were married!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
Never heard from him again?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He still living?
You thought any more about our murder?
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
There was a mandate in the last election--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I've seen 'em.
And my father?
People didn't complain?
I don't think you can take it personally--
I'm not open. We were just talking.
What?
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Morning, Sheriff.
Time marches on.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
So why did you come back here, Sam?
We thought we were something, didn't we?
So what are we gonna do about this?
How long have you lived here?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
We start from scratch--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
How 'bout you?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Thanks, Billy.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
If you've lied to me to me --
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
And are you afraid?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Are they treating you okay?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
What did you find?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I was so afraid.
Are you sure?
Are you all right?
I've got to help him.
Bad show last night?
... they believe you.
Oh God.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Trickery and divinity.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
What are you, my mother?
Then what do you want?
Philip Swann?
Are you sure?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
She has no real grip on reality.
You need an ambulance.
My God.
For an introduction.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Look, Ma, no wires.
Oh yeah?
Nobody's better off this wav!
This is where we killed him.
He did something with the ground.
Call me tomorrow.
One question.
Yes! Yes!
And?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Try twenty-five.
Oh, what do you do with that?
Hi again, how's it going?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I don't want to go home.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Oh.
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You made it.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
What happened to your toe?
You think so?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
You know, eat healthier.
Ok.
Hospital?
Evelyn Waugh?
You wanna come?
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh, the record company sent these...
I miss you.
Lauren?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I can take care of myself.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
You'll do it?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
What is it?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You killed my parents.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
So...what did you think of the tape.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Yes, I know.
What are you looking for exactly?
Nothing yet.
Peter, let go of the chair!
No oxygen to the brain.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You know what?  You can go.
He can see you Thursday.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Thanks again for everything.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
Monica, what did you do?
nothing.
What?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
What?
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
So you're still breast-feeding?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Damn, girl.
Nah.
Mom's going to hate it.
I found you someone.
I know...
You do.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
They ever love you back?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
But?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
One, up.
So...does it hurt?
For real?
What do I have to do?
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
So?
A ride home.
What's that?
Mulholland Drive.
Why?
What was that about?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
So how about a little one-on-one?
Give me the ball.
I won.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
You want to go talk?
What?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
What are the doctors saying?
Actually, I don't...
So why'd you give up ball?
What will this prove?
Hey, girl.
Give it yourself.
Yeah.
What is this?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
Guess he talked to you.
Just...leave it alone.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
What people?
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I ain't a damn liar.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
Look, I'm busy.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Uh-huh.
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
Don't sit down.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
...Hello...?
For what?
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Eight o'clock?
Billingsley's?
So you've done it --
Why not?
You wanna make a deal with me?
You really use strong language.
Yeah.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I'm sorry --
Just say no.
No, what's wrong?
You live alone?
Where's the news department at this studio?
Not enough, what do you want?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
DAD --
It's ok --
How much you pay me for my help?
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Did you listen to me?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Is it real love?
....do you know who I am?
Picky, picky.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
You see?
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
...ah...
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...cocksucker....
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I'm gonna start rolling --
-- just to clarify --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Psychology major?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
He's in here.
Is he in pain?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
You can't just come in here.
I don't have to answer your questions.
Marcie.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
You look great.
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Come home soon after the show.
-- did she talk to you?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Can I come in?
Was it a call back?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
I can't.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Your Majesty...
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What do you propose to do?
It can.  I know the way.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
You can do it.
Now.  You were saying?
Hang himself?!
What you're asking is impossible!
Aramis, this will never --
But --
Bloody hell...
He seeks redemption.
Mother of God!
And why are you so glum?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
Do I look all right?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
But -- are you sure?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
A personal nature?
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Silence!  I order you!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Continue.
... The ball... Continue.
Food, moron.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Captain Doyle?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Every step of the way.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
What?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Something I don't already know?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Captain?
No...
What exactly did you see?
And what did you do?
I had it all on tape...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
What?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
No...
And?...
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
You must be going somewhere.
What?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Get him to Atlanta.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
What'd it say?
Get me a plane...
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Ride with me.
You worked out well.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Do you feel privileged?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's very strong physically.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
'Intimate? !"
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
What happened to them?
No.
What the hell can I do?
If I were?
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Then why?
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
What will you do?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
What's this Mama shit?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Meet point's up ahead!
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I figured I'd ask you...
How?
What kind of coffee do you like?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Do you dream much, Will?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
People love... comedians.
Sitcom...?
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Andy!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
I'm sorry, George...
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
What was that all about?
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Five.
Ten.
Right...
What do you mean?
Hi...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Go away.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
GET OFF!
So?  What do they know?
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
It's so dirty.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Can I help you with something?
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Bob.
A -- a tourist.
Then the informant is real.
They are dead.  In either case --
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Five.  Since I've been here.
Just get me outta here.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
Do you understand, Neo?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Hello?
That vase.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
What?
How did you do that?
What the hell is this?!
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
Did you go to her?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
What?
No one has ever done anything like this.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Why?
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
They've burned through the outer shields.
Know where he is?
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
No, all we got is $40.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I gotta get the stuff.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Where to?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
What happened to you Flash?
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Back so soon.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Oh Michael, look...
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Hey, where you been?
No, she's got epilepsy.
No.
Bore.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
How much?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
What, honey?
-- Black.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Honey, please.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Hot or cold.
Yes.
Who are we talking about?
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I'm all excited --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
You're overthinking it --
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
What you then?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' be facety, woman.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Thanks.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Susan?
I came to see you.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Has her pain abated?
Where are you going?
For how long?
Well -- I --
'Love will find out the way'?
Susan --
No --
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
No --
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Yes.
Now I'd like to be alone.
And more.
What's okay?
You are?
So that's what love is?
Okay.
Joe, don't do this --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You want me to be your guide --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
What the hell are you talking about?
What question?
The 'question' --
This one.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Good morning, Dad.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Drew told me.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Don't get carried away.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Aw, you're tough.
Thank God.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Are you okay?
What?!
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
You don't know anything about Joe --
I don't know, I can't say --
What a night.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Why?
21.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
47.
Burt.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
It's isolated.
Who?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Calm down.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
There's a dress code?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
This is your car.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
You really want to find this guy?
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Unfinished business.
She has no idea who I am.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Envelopes?							    *
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
No, you won't.
What was it for?							   *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
No.  I was in Namibia...
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
And...?
Sal Maguda.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
What do you think?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I got the item.
Make it 40%.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
What do you like to drink?
The Keys?
Were you born in Havana?
How's he not your husband?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
I insist.
I forgot the napkins.
...in the morning.
José...
You afraid of violence?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah?
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And there's Dmitri...
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where the hell are you, man?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
So what do you want?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Alonzo...!
How'd they get onto you?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
What flowers?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Then what were we talking to you for?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
What the hell did you do?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
You think I'm lying!
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
You don't seem like no fag...
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Ready for hard work, son?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
The kids? Why are they...
Tunnel?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
It's there!
To what?
Dad...I'm...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Sixty Lira?
Those mountains? are they?
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Got a family back there?
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
How's it feel?
And you?
What they give you?
How much did you have?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Just got some news on Bell.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
You feel anything?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid...
What do you-?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Hello.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Here.
You're very kind...
You want to read it?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
See, isn't this nice?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
To Misery.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Yes, Paul.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Hey, Pete.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
See anything you like?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Where?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
We're due to take off.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
- this is very disconerting..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
They've got a book for this?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Have you met them?
I managed.
Are you okay?
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Something else?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I don't.  No exactly.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
A visit from an old friend.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Satisfied?
I'm walking.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
What are you going to do?
May I come in?
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I didn't say that.
Okay...
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Whoís dead?
Youíre in Prague?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
What?
What kind?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Higher.  Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I guess.
Why not?
How was Chicago?
You're going to use Walter?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
What's going on?
That's what we do isn't it?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
I have my eyes open.
Where's Ma?
Here.  Ti amo. 
He got hit by a bus.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Yeah.
You're my father.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
It's wrong to just let them go.
I have no life.
That's it.
Fast.
No.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Yes.
I was dead.
Your blood.
What? What have we done?
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did I do?
Alright.
Hi.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
No thanks.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
He's coming.
You've gotta get outta here.
No, I'll tell him.
You don't want the fish.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
No.
Why not?
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
What the hell happened to you?
WHAT!! She was dying!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
No.
Don't fight.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Who was that?
That's it! That's the reason!
Have you come to make peace with me?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Thanks, comrade.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
It's a house.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
She's got it.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
I see.  Yes, of course.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Get away!
Where did you get the coconuts?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Who are the Britons?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
What is that?
None shall pass.
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Are you sure he's got one?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Nu!
Ni!
There!  Look!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Make a bridge out of her.
I think I'll go for a walk.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
I can't.
Gosh - Is he all right?
Do you want to come and have a drink?
I don't want land.
Herbert.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well, look er, I ...
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
They're all saying the word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Bravely ran away, away.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You should have someone look after you.
It's what the maids are for.
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
What did you say?
Mother....
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Checked and locked, sir.
You'll be sent a message.
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Awaiting my orders.
What brings you here?
You sent for me.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
She'll never understand it.
And the pony?
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
We're going to lose.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
What's her excuse this time?
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Well?
How long has he been this sick?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
There is one other matter.
Ma'am?
What is the matter with him?
Does that thing work?
Dead?
Talk to me.
What's her problem?
Hello?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
So how did it know my name, then?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Something's happened to them.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
SLIP-STREAM.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
Shit...
Our time's up.
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So what do you think?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Howdy!
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
It will work out.
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Wow!
There was an accident. I came here.
A car ... a car accident.
Betty Elms?
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
Was anyone hurt?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What is it Rita?
What do you mean? You're Rita.
What's wrong with that?
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Those men in front, in the car.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
To my audition.
No, we don't.
Yeah, what for?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
You feel it?
Nice wallets.
Palmdale.
Not here...no thanks.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Where are we ?
Why should we trust you ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I... I .....
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
What's next Walt ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Where ?
Trust is earned not given away.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Zachary.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
So who are these people with the Boss ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
What's next ?
Look he figured it out !
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Really ? On a date ?
What an incredible view !
Are you okay ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Are you okay ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
How's your foot ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Do what?
Visualize a spare?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
No nuns, got it.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Totally.
We have a baby?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'm glad you're here.
Special effects?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Hi.
Is it okay if I drink this?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
He's writing. Hello?
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Get married?
Care for a smoke?
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Does it work?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
You mean,  this ring?
My mother stood on this very spot.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
An adventure?
No?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Lock the door.
Maybe.
I should do this myself.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
The boss is watching us...
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
They're dead?
I need the job.
Uh huh?
You don't like it?
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Home sweet home.
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Dad?
Goodnight Vada.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Well well well, what's going on in here?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Does he love her?
Do you like her?
Who's winning?
Maybe black means you're happy?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Daddy??!?!?!
Thomas J?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
What's wrong with your eyes?
No, I don't wanna.
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Woah!!
What do you want it for anyway?
Run faster they're after us!!
Get up!?
I do, she's real funny.
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
You don't miss much.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
We'll never be the same.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
I give.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Excuse me?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
So... one almost has to...
Exactly what?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
I never want to go through this again.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Is anybody watching?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
What's the sec...
Waiter! Check, please!
You never eat when you're despondent.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Will she like it?
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
And to m...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
I hate that music.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
What did you say your name was?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
What do you really want?
You bet.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
How is she?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Yes, but we're just singing.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
You bet.
What?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Uh huh.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
I don't think so.
Who is thin?
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Premeditated murder.
You know who that is?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Hello. John Triplette.
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Probably a little too long.
Pleasure
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
You think it will?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
What did you think then?
Naw, she don't mind.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Looked like an interview to me.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Yeah.
How come you never talk?
Say something.
Do you have a back up.
You ready, Donut?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
What I'd like to do---
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Was what worth it?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
I could go for a Coke.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Who?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Two guys?
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Yeah.
Give her a beer.
Want me to come?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Boy - you hear me?!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
'You Duff Anderson?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I said: Cut it out!
Yeah.
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Don't say much, do you?
His profession?
Been over to the other mill?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
I'm a teacher.
How d'you mean?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Not here, Duff.
What d'you mean?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
What d'you mean?
Don't push me, Duff.
What about that girl?
Everything you cook is good.
You know how to box?
My kids want me to teach them.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Where're you going to go?
A whole lot, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
Wouldn't have known you.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Come back some other time, will you?
Well, what're you going to do?
Don't be too hard on him.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
So I been told.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Got a thick feelin' here.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
How long's it been?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
You're hurt...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Yo.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Where the hell have you been?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Case... it's four a.m.
I'll get the car.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
I know.
Is he going to make it?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Now this is cute.
Wings?
He is totally crunching on you.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Better person than I.
Wow. This must be big.
What!?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Whoa. Deja Vu.
I love the way she writes.
Sure, why?
Are you--scared?
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Yes.
Why not?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you sure?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What is this place?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Jesse, God - what happened?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
'Morning.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
We're going up to bed now.
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
That was different.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
You got five minutes.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
You're late.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Lovely to meet you.
That was such a great evening.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No!
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Hi.
Are you busy tonight?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Too complicated.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
How are you doing?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
This is certainly... ah...
You disappeared.
I thought I'd give it to you.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
What does it say?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
No.  Not true...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I did.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Any more announcements?
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Spike!
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Billy?
Yes, ma'am...
Is there anything else?
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yeah?
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Whatcha boys playin'?
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long suckers.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
H-H-Help!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Marry who?
Say... God Bless America!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
It's the questions she asks.
What? What?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
He can't hear you!
So why are you talking to him?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Let me see your hand!
When?
Hit me!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
I wanna see it...
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
I don't, Doc...
You bet, Doc!
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
No!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Oh yeah...
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hi.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
He is your husband, no?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Excuse me?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So, what's the story with your friend?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
We found each other, didn't we?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
...has a prior commitment.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Damon Bradley...
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
I'd really rather not say.
So.  You found him.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
You're Damon Bradley?
So what do you think?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
You okay?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
We're saved!
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
I'm hungry.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
What did you say to her?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
It's siesta.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Huh?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I came after the woman I love.
She what?!
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
That's right... .
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
It was you, Charley... .
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
They play pretty rough.
You know how the Sisters are.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
What's that?
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Were you really a prize fighter?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Terry!
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
And if you don't?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
Told him what?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
My hand.
Terry, for God's sake.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Am I on my feet...?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
I don't get it!
I want to see you, Terry.
Your gun.
What did you say?
...walk?
You can!
Who asked him here?
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
You still call it ratting?
So help me God!
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Give me a double.
Terry?  What do you want?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
If I could get my hands on you...
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
What can we do?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
You love me then?
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
When!?
I understand, Master
There are others.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
You better hope there is.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
What do you suppose for?
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Yes.
Why not?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
You're good.
Adele?  You in there?
I'm not dressed.
Where in the hell are we?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You find out?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
You ever wear one of these?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
You talked to him?
I have to qualify, is that it?
Sure, Daniel.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Hello?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
How much for your company at chow?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Nervous?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Boy, it stunk in there.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I mean, romantically.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
You know who this is?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You like taking risks.
You coming back?
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
You're not dumb.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
So.  What's your point?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
I hear six.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Hi, Ray.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Moselle Miller?
You like to sit down?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Technically.  They're separated.
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
I really gotta go.
You were talking in your sleep.
He doesn't even look like that.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You wave back?
How do I look, mama?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
What?
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
They ready, Earl?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I didn't mean it.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Get me into a plane!
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Sorry.
So beautiful!
Don't get smart with me, son.
Well sure, Colonel --
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Sorry to trouble you.
What do you get for winning?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
What's the matter?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
But you love me don't you?
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You got a Tab?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
He's trying.
Charlie, let's make love.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Charlie. About last nights..
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What're you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Hello, Charlie.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
I beg your pardon?
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Coffee and a donut.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
I thought I knew everything about him.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Hi, Dad.
Yes.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I'm excused.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Where have you been?
Don't eat the red ones.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
You look exactly the same.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Will you take of f your blouse?
I came to say goodbye.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Is something wrong?
So where're we going?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How did it go with your father last night?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Allright. Calm down.
Thanks, you guys.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm not going to die.
Thanks for coming in.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Client of yours?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Big trouble.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
What do you want?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
What?
I know a good probate lawyer.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
In some situations.
Yes.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Leave that.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Great.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Lots.
Since when?
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Going on... like...?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
What? What is it?
Bottle-count.
What whispers?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
You'd die for them?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Hey.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
So now you know.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Well, don't ask me to.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
He can pilot?
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Owens!
One is all?
Imam. Slow down.
And pointless.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
What the hell are these?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
The best. But we won't need them.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Well, maybe they're not.
How did it go?
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
He's trying to form words.
What happened?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
All right --
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Can we take a dip?
I told you not to bring the other one.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
How so?
You lied. Where is your tribe?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
What is your proposal?
Tell him to pull back!
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Would you like to come along?
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But the proof? The doll?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
First time?
And you, do you believe?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I think you're drunk.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
I didn't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Want to dance?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Then he's got to be a detective.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
No.  I paid him off.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Beer or ale, Miss?
That's an evasion and you know it.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
You've had dealings with the police before?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
We try to be decent.
I can't answer that.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Private eye?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Got it on you?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Who told you my name?
The usual grind.
How are you two getting along?
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
A little something on account perhaps?
What are you doing here?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Got a moment, Inspector?
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
What's the face for, Driscoll?
You in charge here?
Right.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Was that about the right angle?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
What about me?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
No.
So-so.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I have a rough idea.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
It's terribly good.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Again?
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
Blasé and epicene.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
Oh, I see.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Hello, Jimmy.
We'll see what we can do.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
We're wasting time.
I can't do this.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Good move.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Johnny, it's the only way.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
... so I started tailing him.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
They're on their way to Maui.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Who's the girl?
Meaning you were expendable.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Ouch.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Bye.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Thanks.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
You saw what?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
What in God's name...?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Your uncle will like this.
There's no way you could know that.
I like your hat.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
What's that long building over there?
Congratulations, sir.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
No, but it's getting there.
Three hundred.
Get in.  This side.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Always.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
It's a very good year.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
By breaking up a company's assets --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
It'd cost you.
But you want days too.
The Rex.
I'm sorry.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Real genuine guy.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
Do I look okay?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Why do you want to know?
You're being ridiculous.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Who did you think?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Want a pair of boots?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
Oooh, I love those.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Would you like to try it on?
Having a good time, Vivian?
Get out!
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
He will come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Who are you?
Catch your breath.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Have you any money?
You've been mostly dead all day.
Inigo.
-hold it, hold it-
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
What?
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
Yellin.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Thank you for everything.
Go in, get after her!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me explain-
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
-- get back, witch --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, it's quite possible.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What???
Where would you like to eat?
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What is she gonna do here?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Don't help me.
Vat about it?
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
You, Blum go Motel.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
The Blue Max...
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
The following morning. Sunday.
No! Of all...
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
Of course not.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
I don't know.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
Were there any calls?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Yes.
She stole some money.
I'm Mary's sister.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
It's been three.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
What?
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I've caused you some trouble.
You eat like a bird.
I imagine so.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Phoenix?
You slept here all night?
Is anything wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
...Forty thousand dollars!
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
How do you do.
What's down there?
What is it now?
You're losing your blood?
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
You lie!
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I think so.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Call the Homicide Squad!
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Oh, is that what caused it?
What is it? What happened?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Is that a fact?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Mia...?
Could be.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Dysfunctional --
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
In what sense were they bad?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
'Course it does.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
You better quit that.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
What do you think, Brother?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
The new girl is here.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Why is it taking so long?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Please do.
Of course.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Quarter of twelve.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Honey!
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
How is she?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Um-m, well...
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Yes, dear, what is it?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Rose, you don't have to.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Who cares?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
What'd I say?
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
No offices are gonna be open today.
That's them trying to kill us.
When you planning to cut back on that?
The booze.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Where we going?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
I can't believe we're stealing.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Alright?
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Why the beach?
Do tell.
You see that?
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
They are clear, my Master.
Han!
Are you all right?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Someone who loves you.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
What's going on?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Here we go again.
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I'm going in.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
You!
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
I was telling the truth.
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Right!
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Good God.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
What guy
Was all I had to say
Dealing
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Some people are very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
D'you really wanna call?
...What?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...I can't beat him.
No... I can't!
Paulie, please --
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
No doctor!
Damn.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Six!
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
I say ya nothin'!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
I feel bad about walkin'.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Make your teeth yella --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
...What?
The legs must be goin'.
...Who'd ya fight?
Did ya get the message, kid?
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Really think so?
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
It don't bother me none.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
You ballin' her?
Outta my house I want ya!!
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
What was <u>that</u>?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Does it hurt?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Now what?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
Keep reading...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
A most courteous exposition.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Lose them!
About time!
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Then where is it?
Gregor, is that you?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
A means to an end, is that it?
And you respect him.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
American.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Where is this broad?
Is that right?
He says this is their block.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What's the difference?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
What's going on?
I borrowed that, too...
It was at that.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
You know him?
It is at that.
What the fuck happened?
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Because I don't walk away.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You son-of-a-bitch...
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What happened to it?
What's the story?
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
What the hell happened here?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
What are we going to do?
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
That's right!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Okay then.  I'll do it.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
You're out of your mind.
Do you have everything?
We're not?  How do you figure that?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's too late...
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
Yeah?  So?
Hi.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
So do I.
How are we going to do all this?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Something wrong, Jesse?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne please calm down!
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
Is that the mail?
Don't you want it?
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Two-hundred thousand!
Invitation, please.
So tell me what you know.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
I'm sorry.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Hello.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Not Yu.  You!
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
It sounds impossible --
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He'll be back soon.
No.  It was my singing.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
She's getting undressed.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
I'm not used to having a partner.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Vegas...
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
What is this?
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Put your arms around me.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Good job.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
Beach Boy.
Help me Rhonda.
It's the same thing!
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You like it?
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
How about a lift home?
What kind of assignment is that?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Yo, Johnson...
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
My daughter.
Yes.
I do.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
What is he up to now?
Right.
Yes.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
You look awful.
Got any last minute advice?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
"Sink the putt."
Rub your ears.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
In vino veritas.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Okay, we'll order out.
Thanks.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
They made me put my hat back on.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
How romantic.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Maybe someday.
Always a mood killer.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Where did you disappear to?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
It's fun!  It's high.
Brian told you that?
Lost!
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
I love you.  I love you.
Used?
I'm listening.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
I'm going to kill myself.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
You tell Maggie.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hate boats.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Even when you were young?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
It's delicious, trust me.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
What was that about up there?
What?
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hi.
It's you.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Hello.
It's been about a year and a half.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
It is not --
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
No, I'm not, but --
Sure.  Looking good.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Will she scratch up your back?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
This one's for both of us.
Great.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Have you seen my wallet?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Do you like baseball?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Hi.
You look good.
Is he there?
He's ten.
I read an article about this ...
You're welcome to one.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Got any more ideas?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
A fighter, huh?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Go on. Spill it.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
Well, if that's possible ...
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
What can I do for you?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
It's not that easy.
I can't.
You don't understand.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
: What are you up to?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Who is it?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
What time is it?
Where to?
What?
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
You don't trust me?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What the hell is this?
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
Danny, I'm touched.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
What're your taking down?
Danny?
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
This the guy?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
The Mexicali Boys
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Jimmy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Tom, quit fucking around.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
We're in business.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Yes, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
So, that's Ryan.
Y'all come back.
What do you think?
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Upham?
I wasn't made for this.
Over three-hundred.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Captain, what about our deal?
Worked, didn't it?
Caen?
Beasley's dead.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Huh?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Don't do that again.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
How fast?
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hi.
Thanks, I like yours too.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
You're tough, J-man.
C'mon, just do it.
Please?
Did you sleep with her?
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
What does it say?
I don't feel anything.
I can put that together.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
I won?
Morning honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Lloyd?
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
That's right, work it out.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
So you're monumentally busy?
Actually, I think that I...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
What are these?
So it's an honor?
Yeah.
Oh.
After work?
Okay, bye.
You have to meet Bess.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
We'll see.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Did you talk to Corey?
Did you tell anybody?
Okay.
Good to know.
PAIN!
Jim Court?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
My car.
Diane Court.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Oh, I was just going to...
I love you man.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
All right, okay, let's talk.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
What are you doing?
Oskar, good of you to come.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
What others?
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
We need to talk.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I didn't do enough.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
I can do it, Captain.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
I don't think that's a good idea.
It helped me realize one thing.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Where's Sid?
No way.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Why?
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
So we found a compromise.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Yeah?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Who is this?
I don't play games.
What do you want from me?
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Yes, goddammit!
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
How many guys they have on you?
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..it's really about family and tradition...
She's not here right now.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
What do you know about trilogies?
Did you request this case?
Excuse me?
How is that good news?
Detective Kincaid?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Jennifer needs me.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Possibly.
Nobody said she was an actor.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Are you saying she was-
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
You're not happy with your part.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
No.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Hello?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
She can't get both of us.
Billy? What the...
Close call.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Who did you call?
So why did you dial it again?
What?
Popcorn.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
Gotta go.
Yes?
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
Please don't do this...
...please...
No...
You tricked me...
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Have they found my father?
She staying with you?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
That fish smelled strong.
Where is she?
What? What?
What's the plan?
Please. You owe me.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Stu was with me last night.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
You coming tonight?
Which is you...
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Do you believe this shit?
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Who?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
TATUM!
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Here he comes.
I... I don't follow.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's my wife.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
There must be something.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Does this make it with you?
How did the fire fight end?
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
What are you going to say?
Are you alright?
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You know he's fucking us.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Stay with him.
Tell me it's not true.
Put your gun down!!
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
But Mose Harper said...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I say NO!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I've come now...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
What you want me to call you?
What you goin' to do?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
I think maybe we oughta...
Ethan, quit it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
They'll be back...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Might at least have left me my pants!
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
Ellen, move aside...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
What?
Martin, what-
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Ellen.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
You did not like the speech?
You are a gentleman.
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Wait!  Will you desist!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
What is the chief part?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Is it going well?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
No Juliet?!
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
By God, I wish I knew.
Another little problem.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
As a nurse.
Your mother, and your father
What do you love so much?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Moonlight!
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, Will!
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Will you read it for me?
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady Viola.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
He is dead?
Take off your hat.
And her lips?
But what of Lord Wessex?
How do I offend, my lord?
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
What's his name?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Only on expenses.
So who's going to do it?
No, not that.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
I don't know.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
How much?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Just one thing.
Right.
That's right.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- instead of what he is --
Hugo.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
So?
Now?
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
What's he doing here?
No.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
What?
Don't you ever stop?
What?
Can you afford this place?
Downstairs.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Of course.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Is this where no one stays?
Yes.
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred.
Who have you talked to?
So let's go.
But they sneer, don't they?
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
What do you do?
Writing seems easy.
It was some guy called Brian.
Your watch.
Chicken salad.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I don't know.
I know.
I don't want to talk about it...
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- Anyway.
I know.
Like what?
Are you in love with her?
Then it's not your problem.
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No kidding.
You are.
What sort of references do you have?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Jesus...
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
How long you had this?
I'm sure.
Where do you want to do this?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
... I don't get it done often.
It was after you, baby. After you.
George...
It'll ruin everything.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- you are.
I don't know what gets into me.
You don't think so? I do.
Where do you want to go?
-- yeah.
Am I entertaining you?
-- good afternoon --
I've got to leave?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
-- It's Malone's.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
God, there's Lester...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
Oh yeah?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- White ladies?
Call me!
There were some shots.
Now, George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Yeah, baby...
Egypt.
When?
When is that?
Never mind. Where've you been?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Now, Jackie --
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Yes.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
Baby, don't do this --
How?
What? What? What? What? What?
I wish you'd go now.
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
No.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But what?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Well anyway...
This really ought to be layered...
All night.
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
What took you so long?
You're home.
I'm coming over.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Sid.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
Who are they?
Does she know about us?
-- you phony asshole --
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I thought you said things were great with George.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
What?
Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
You're going?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Do you have something against traveling?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Are you sure?
Maybe he showed me something.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Yeah, I guess so.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Yeah.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
It's so pretty.
I won't make any noise.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Mommy...
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Oh,
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Tony.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
It's okay, really.
Sure.
Delbert Grady.
No.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
It's good to see you.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Get him out of here?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Jack, stay away from me!
I'll bring back a doctor.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
Yes. Go away.
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
Are you all right, Marty?
Mom-!
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Don't call me dear boy.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Was it a prescription?
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
But how?
SING!
How come?  Sister?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
This prom is a real drag.
Where did that come from?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Is this... choir practice?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
What?
Hopeless I
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
You have to help me
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Goddamn it!
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
I see.
And all those like you.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Is this all the food I get?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It never solves anything.
So... hi there.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
A vote?
You sent for me?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
He's a businessman.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
No nothing.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
But you didn't tell me!
Well?
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She's a nun, Vince.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
They spend two days in chains.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Very few, if any.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
We should not go much further in this murk.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
What is it?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
What good is this?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What now?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
It is only me.
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
I know you saw me.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Thank ye.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Yeah.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
What's you last name?
Why'd you live there?
How come?
Did you want to play ball with us?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Were they bad people?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Oh, jackin' off?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Why?
What you readin'?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
You all right, Mama?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
A blister shore can hurt.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Why are you here now?
Do you have family here?
Naw, I ain't.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He just got out of the state hospital.
What about me?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Where will he go?
Will he be supervised?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
What!
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
They're all the same.
I've never seen anything like it.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
Hey, man, good to see you.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Did you ever go back to see her?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
No you're not.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
What's this?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
A little. Not much.
It's for you.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
I figured he had a right to know.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Here and there. Around.
I didn't expect to see you again.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
And?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
I don't know.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hi, kid.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
I don't know.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
It is.
Now, Mister Gi...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
Did you write that column?
You don't believe in God anymore.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
Did you say more?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
I did.  Boy.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Well, why does it?
That's when he fell.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You think so?
What for, Sheriff?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
You wouldn't even see it move.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Does it now?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Can I say something, here?
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Improved...how?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Wanna see my driver's license?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
With me?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
This way, Daphne.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What happened?
I'll say there is!
Jerry - there's another problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
What'll I tell him?
We'll take a rain check.
Are my seams straight?
Good night, Sugar.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
And that's one of them.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Anything wrong?
And your head is hot.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Did he get fresh?
How did you get that bracelet?
I always did.
Where did you girls play before?
I was it.
What's wrong with us?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Please.  It won't happen again.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
I don't care.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Anything today?
Oh?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Tell what?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Me?
Rough?
Bingo?
You know - I play tenor sax.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
What's happened?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
How's the stock market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Oh?
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Love it.  Which way?
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Look at all that silverware.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
See?  Nothing.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Is that anything?
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Daphne -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Refresh my memory.
Thanks, Charlie.
Christ, Amy.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
You heading to the train station?
What’s his problem?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, Kat.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
So, what’s your point?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Brilliant.
Mission accomplished.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Six thousand, right?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Would you grab my shampoo?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
What?
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Hi.
I should go.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
I am now, sir.
And you say all them people is dead now?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Well, looka here...
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
From Miss Johnson --
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
'Bye, Mama...
What is it, David Lee?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
How's the weather out there?
What did he want?
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Fuckin' a right.
Is it Cartman's mom?
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
I can't believe he's dead.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
Did you bring the pie and punch?
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Oh yeah.
Kyle?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
What's that?
No... The General is right.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
What's a butfor?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
That was sweet!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
This is sweet!!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
Stan!
Thank you, Kenny.
And Bill?
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
It's from your mother.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
I think we're moving.
Oh yeah...
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Were you going to give it to them?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Barnes?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Is that clear?
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I can't let you do that.
I don't know what we're facing.
Yeah.  We did it.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
In that case, I accept.
What is it?!
Thank you.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Is it safe for human transport?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
How do you turn this thing off?
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
My poor baby!
Hello?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Theo. Howzitgoin.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Yeah.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Whoa.
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
What's plan B?
Do you talk with your mom?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
You should.
Where are you going?
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Very professional.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Get out of there!
Hold on --
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Don't do it!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Anything else?
How deep is he?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Edmunds?
You think he killed Edmunds?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Yes, sir.
You don't know that.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
From the sphere?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Norman!
Where'd this come from?
Wait a minute.
You fixed my suit?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Diphenyl parlene.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Riordan?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Three to six hours.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
Did you?
Someone did.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
That's when you went in the sphere.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Don't, Beth.
Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth?
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You hear that?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Then what is it?
What are you looking for?
Just in time, too.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
When did it come across?
You holding up alright?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon, Norman.
Our answer.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I don't follow you.
Norman?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
... you there?  Norman?
Norman, where are you?
We're never gonna make it.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
Her legs are in the way.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Well, if it's a discharge --
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
How are the others?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
What was it?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Good morning!
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
You saw through me?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Are you all right?
The Kiber Crystal.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Here come six more... grid two!
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
Who's the pilot?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
I think she's going to be all right.
No need, everything's under control.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
See Threepio... do you copy?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
I'm all ears.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
So ?
Carmen...?
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You're late.
You talk to Carl ?
You don't look very happy to see me.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
...I'm sorry.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
What ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Uh, look, Diz...
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
C'mon...
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
...CUT OFF !
Oh, my, what's that ?
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Hit your jets, sir !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
<U>Why</U>...?!
Disclose the information.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Captain, what's the next move?
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
They had a pattern to follow...
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
Then you'll be wet.
You bringing your new friend?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
You haven't heard of it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
You get what you pay for.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
...such a pleasant sound.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I...
Me?
What happened?
...lost the screw...
Gonna' be good as new.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
...yes.
That's right...
Hi.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
What is it all about?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Ten thousand dollars.
Hi!
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
Mornin', Doc...
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
They think it's your First Wife...
Bobby, don't say anything.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Are you all right...?
Her...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Are you Okay?
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Nobody.
You have no right to...
But not that <u>way</u>...
...we had a script conference...
Claire, when did you...
This is Joe White.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
...I know...I know...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...yes...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Kiss my ass.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
I have to talk to you.
Doug...
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
My wife's going to have a baby.
What?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
How do they know that, you told them?
How do you know you saw it?
What is that...?
My oh my.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
Marty...
It's just a formality.
Pay her off.
Yeah?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Do something.
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
Zat true?
Why?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
It just slipped out.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
That happens.  To families.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
And don't tell her I told you.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
I don't want to say goodbye.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Uh.  What is it?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
...your hating me.
No.
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
No.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
You say that like I don't know that.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
We...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Yet another spaghetti night.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
What did you do?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
...in.
I have a snoop.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
You feeling all right?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Look, you've never liked me...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Small world.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Can I look at the pictures?
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're lying.
Why didn't I?
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
She's not gonna die.
Why in the world would she t...
Can we go sit somewhere?
Restless.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
You heard me: leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey.
There are some rumors...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Consuelo?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
You have a bay?
Why was he on Death Row?
The camerawork's nice.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Don't even joke about that!
Mom?
Marty...
It's all about who you know.
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Ready for tomorrow?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Hey, Mikey!
That's good.
It's over there.
Fuck me hard!
I hate reading.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I believe it.
Huh. Kids?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Whoopee.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What are we going to do!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Cooper...
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
I have a lighter!
How well do you know this place?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Come on, drink up.
What about Cooper--where is he?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
So, what are we looking at White?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
How goes the roll call?
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Get your men to do it!
Can I have a glass of water?
I have your word, Mister President?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
What are you talking about, Major?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Does the threat board show anything?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Why do you think I ask?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Suppose that were the case?
How much soda, sir.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
And you'd like to see that?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Roger, maintain.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Check.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
So am I.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
What's your point, Lothar?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Second safety.
Master safety.
He's dead, all right.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
That's the point.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Sure, King.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
In Group?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
That was really great.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Any gunshot victims?
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
Don't let 'em fight.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long, long, while.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Yeah.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
I know, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
Hey, man.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Oh, you were in the band?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
It's safe, come on.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Whoa!
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Come on. Inside.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
You rich?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Deep down. Way down.
I know. It's okay.
Oh, wow.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff! Come up here!
Oh! Trim it!
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
About things that are important to me.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
What feelings?
So what do you wanna do?
New ground?
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Where are you going?
I've run out of words.
You really suck, you know that?
Good, man.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
I don't know.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my property!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
You do not want me to do your cover.
Alright, alright already.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Positive.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
Hi, Jack.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Madonna.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Ammo?
You want us to help you pick up?
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
They could kill you.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
What about all those ideas you had?
It's just impossible.
So do I.
Good.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Just a minute, you!
You're a writer, you said.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
I want you to do this work.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I need some money right now.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Keep it.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Did she read the script?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
You are not dressed properly.
I made your bed this afternoon.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
We're from different worlds.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I'm not mad at you.
And now?
You think so?
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Why should I believe you?
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Why the empty cage?
Hey, where you going?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
There isn't any.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Nigel, get lost.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
What is this place?
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Zaltar, please help me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
You're going to take me back?
You're welcome...??
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Peanut butter and jelly.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What kind?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Man, what is this?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
What?
Is this whitemail?
A computer.
Everything.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
You want to mess with Superman?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Oh, Superman!
I can't! It's out of control!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
85,000 dollars.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Are you okay?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Everything on it?
A parka.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Shhhhhhh!
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Superman! The --
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Who is this . . . Superman?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Yes, but will you honor it?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
General --- ?
You're late. Very late.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Gee, I'm really sorry.
No Paris?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Impossible? Why?
I think he's kind of cute.
I think there's an angle.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
What was that about?
He's . . . cold. . .
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I'm not going anywhere.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
You're a great architect, Albert.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
I'd like to.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Are there any more at home like you?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Can I take you to the airport?
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
What'd you call him?
Oh.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Bet he makes it.
Krypton!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
You're happy, aren't you?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
It's a ...baby.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
I guess I got carried away
Do as I say. Let go!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
How much do you weigh?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Where do you hail from?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him steady employment --
What is this??!
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Ally.  That's right.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
I can help you.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I'll be back around nine.
So what brings you out tonight?
What time's he coming home?
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
Good night, Billy.
Why did you do that, Billy?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
That's right.
Excuse me?
You heard what Abbott said?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
You want a cup of tea or something?
What happened to summer?
From you?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
What about Doreen?
That's the local bar?
What do you mean?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Need a hand?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Why can't you talk to me?
I tested positive.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
You think someone else caused the accident?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Why were you scared?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You remember this?
That was great.
Of course.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
Pretty slick, eh?
Do you like the colour?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yes.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
But of course...
He's somewhere...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
I know Steve.  No.
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
How?
He means that much to you...?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
What does that mean - integrity?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
And where was his wife?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
That's the third time he's called today.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
But...
Who else phoned?
You ought to be used to me by now.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
You're talking very fast.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
You haven't told him yet...
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I made you write a beautiful song...
You going to work all day?
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
We should abort.
My God.
No good.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Can I stop by my house?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Everything.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Not even of dying?
Torque wrench please.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
It must end here... or I am the future.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
No shit?
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
Ready to rock?
I know!
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
You look like handmade shit.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
I must be destroyed.
Are you afraid?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
On Furtwängler.
What does he mean, too correct?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Your mother, too.
What's in those files?
I'm sorry.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Sure.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Then you are wrong.
Yes, I know who he is.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Major.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
And ask him about his private life.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Can you handle it?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
You'll learn.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Is this enough?
My whole life has been combat.
A girl.  You know.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
That stuff's two hours cold.
Same shit.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
You don't talk to me like that.
Clean out your locker.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Pardon me... Miss... ?
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
This can't be real...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
I'll give you a boost.
I'll wait.
Never did catch your name.
Goodnight.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Who are "they?"
Then, what good are you?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Guess you missed it.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Yes.
Happy Birthday, man.
Never better.
Really?
Call that number.
What are you doing?
Who?
Yeah, almost...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How do you know?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Thank you.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Your ex-wife.
What the fuck... ?!
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
It's not going to hold your weight.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
Hmm.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
What happened?
Get a blanket!
Is she asleep?
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
What do you do?
Not really.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Good night, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Nell, what happened?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
What's the matter?
We think someone is here.
Hey.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Edward Rama?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
What more is there.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
You're kiddin' me, right?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Didn't get it.
How d'you mean?
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Weren't you on a television series?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
I bet.
Right.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't seem bothered.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Only in the movies.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Fancy it?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
How much.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
What d'you mean, any happier?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
What?
Like what.
I don't get it.
What's in it?
You know her?
Where is he, then?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
You must know Ian.
Tell you ...
Yes?
...Yes?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
...No, please.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
No problem!
Right! Strictly business.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
She's a rare one.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Dave?
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
How did you get into the store?
Yeah.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Taking it seriously.
...Huh?
I don't work here. My wife does.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
...Ed?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You sure, Eddie?
This hair.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
You don't got a headache?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Behind you.
Fifteen... what's next?
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Lieutenant --
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
I think I should come with you.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
I smell it.  It's here.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Like the claw.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What's going on?
I'm coming with you.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
What's that?
What do you do?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Not that big.
Stop!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Oh... my... God!
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
Then it won't go after the others?
We have to try and draw it off!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I have a map.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Marlon--
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Every time you and Marlon--
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
What did you want?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
How are you, Mother?
--Darling--
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
How can this be?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Yes.
Who called this meeting?
I'm looking for him.
And what's that?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
What killed those men?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Had you.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
What are you implying, Scully?
What did you find?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
You said you weren't coming?
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Been where?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I can't go any farther.
We're going to the morgue.
On whose orders?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Are we being watched?
You're lying.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
More concerns than that?
I'd be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Is it cold in here?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Why'd you bring him here?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Where the hell are we?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Thank you.
Already there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!
Nervous?
Any psychiatric medication?
Agent Novak.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
H-E-Z-T...
Oh, that was many years ago.
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
What happened to your hand?
...again.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Nichts danke. Kein.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Must you take those?
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Yes.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Been here long?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Him dying like that.
Listen, Callaghan.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
This is where he vanished.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Fifty yards right down there.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Win what?
...of Santa Fe."
...his number.
Welcome?
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Mr. Crabbin.
I want to talk to you.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
What do you want me to do?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
...this way.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Dr. Winkel?
Martins.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Could he have been conscious?
Kurtz.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Everyone ok?
A shark fin?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Too far?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Fucking Danny, man...
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What do you think you're doing?
You will.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Are they still together?
Is he a Nazi?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
I want to learn to read it.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
It looks a little like a swastika.
Where are they?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
And? WHat did you notice?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I don't do that.
Don't tell me what I --
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Hello...?
What is it?
Open it up.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Mrs. Moebius.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
How did you know they were Jews?
And what did you do?
Who's this?
So what?
Oh, fuck you...
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Johana, am I boring you?
You're right.  You're fired.
The Italian, I presume?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
You forgot the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
And just where are you from?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Ten thousand.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Yes?
Where did you get that?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
I dove 315 feet!
Madame...
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
He doesn't like us.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Anybody can have a bad day!
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
Don't you have a heater?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Please, have a seat.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'd better get back now.
You sure?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
You'll try again tomorrow?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Uncle Louis!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
... And the new stereo.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So why the long face?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
What was that!?
What!?
Mordechai?
So don't show a picture.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
What are you doing?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Then what do you do?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
I'm sick.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
See you tomorrow —-
Love is different for different people.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
To the eye? Like other men.
It was you, Galbraith!
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
No —— not yet.
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
I got into a little crap game.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Can it be that easy?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You lost my money?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
How... When did you...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
The word for those things is croissants.
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Then find another way.
We’ve still got the Italian...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Where is the Austrian?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Oh... We split up.
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
What happens now?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Let’s go.
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Trying to say something, Martin?
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
Evening. Table for one?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
I’m sorry...
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
It’s wet. Will this do?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
He just said he had good reasons.
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
What about which girlfriend?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Gluck.
So why didn’t he?
Try again, and this time be polite.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
When they realise I’m missing...
Costliest!
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Better today than tomorrow.
Good.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
I am ready now...
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Jeanne's alive!
But that was her order!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
No...
And?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Quick -- hide in here...
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
The voice was in your cell?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Get them out of here!
... as always, majesty...
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
So... what is the message?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Well...?  Shall we go?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
This is no good!
Clear?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
You don't believe me anymore?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
"Love your enemies"...
My father's.
Is that bad?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Hello.
Dorota!
When's your baby due?
Will I still be able to play?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
For what? For my tie?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Can you help us?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
You sell anything?
What did you pay him?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What are you reading?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Dirty pig!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
What about you?
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Yes, why not.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
You the owner here?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
There's always a depression on.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Lonnegan after you, too?
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
You beat him, kid.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
You doin' anything tonight?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
So could Shaw.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
And you were gonna pay me back?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
She's got me worrying, too.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Oh, Andy.
And don't ever try to see me again.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
No.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Mother!
Aren't you Nick Charles?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Come on in.
I don't know.
Hello, Dorothy. 
It's been the same one for three months.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
Not at all.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Have you got a pistol permit?
This gun yours?
Who's is it?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
So would I.
No proof?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Could this be him?
Shut up.
Well....
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
About three.
That's ridiculous.
But he's interested!
I think we may as well sit down.
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'll get some.
Chris!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
We're just having a little drink.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
That's my business.
I never had it.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Oh, please, Nick.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
It might.
I have no right to answer that.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
You did... where?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
All right - you didn't.
So it's you he was after!
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I'd like to see you work.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
He's just been for a walk.
You dog!
Back to California
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Who do you think did it?
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
I'm sorry...  but...
Who fired you?
Where were you going?
What's in the other direction?
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
A casual one.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What?
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Ready?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
You got no reason to do that!
Get off him.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You're out of your mind.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Wes--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Invest it.
It'd make their heads explode.
You didn't step on any mine.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're going to be fine.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I don't hear any--
They're doing more than slapping.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
First Wes, now you?
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Well?
What do you make of them?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
Epps.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Some good ones.
What does that mean?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
Jaeger?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Think we can make it?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
You're going to burn up in those.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
I'm not hungry.
What did you get?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
What time is it?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
I'll try.
It's the end.
There goes another of your disciples.
I thought you were through with it!
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
I've got it!  Astounding!
Why did you have LUH come here?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
What was that....
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
Remember this...?
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
And you are...?
Hey, that's the guy-
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Alright, let's check it out.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
So what were they doing here?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
So cut both.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Fuck factor?
Keep talking.
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
What do you think?
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Glass, what is it?
Then why tell me?
No... No more killing.
Alex, please.
Drop it.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
What was it this time?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
A what?
So what're we looking for?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No!
You're looking fine, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
He's really not a bad fellow.
I would start with cocktails.
I don't want to see you at all!
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Right.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Five, seven, and nine--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Now, Lily--
Lily, you must listen to me.
You like that statue?
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Make it out to cash!
The same thing.
Madame.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Beautiful.
Like that!
I'm crazy about you!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Yes, Gaston?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
It could have been marvelous ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Two lumps, madame?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Your bag?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
The partners want to know how it's going?
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
An accident?!
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Is this in any way unclear?
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
What's this?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And...?
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
I don't know the steps.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
You're trembling.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Now it's worse.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
It's getting quiet.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Anya!
It would be a nice change from you.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Oh--a hundred times--
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Did you find it?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Aces full.
Could I see you a minute?
No gentleman would do that.
I thought you were one of my friends.
Like her paint job?
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Don't be a c-a-t.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
You keep it-- 
Say--wait a minute!
On the drunk.
How's your mother feeling?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Hello, young fellow!
Here's your fifty.
That's too bad.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
What?
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Am I a member of this club?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Very good, Mary--
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
What happened to you?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
How much did you lose?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Congratulations.
That's the truth--every single word!
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I'll explain later--
Nothin'.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
A peace officer... Impressive man
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
Not exactly...
Very cosmopolitan.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Satisfied?
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
You really look awful.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
And I don't even know your full name.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
What can I get you?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Oh, all right.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
What - no lust for adventure?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Gone fishing.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
She married a hockey player.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Interesting presentation.
Bourbon. Neat.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Boyfriend?
I hope you'll be gentle.
If I were you -
... How did you get into marine salvage?
... Yes???
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Who's in charge here?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
You won't get away with this!
Damn. It's doing it again.
What is HE doing here?
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
What did your wife get her?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
That smells like fresh coffee.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
When did you talk to Harry?
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
What are you doing?
How are you?
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Right here in the van.
Here!  In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Yes, I can.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
Great!
Ha-ha!!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
What?
Hey!!
Oh, no!
That ain't no happy child.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
I got it, Woody!
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
Bad news?!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
You're only a young thing.
Who's there?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Stop it!
Finn ...
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
Everything is gone, now.
I'm Melanie.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena --
So my wife is lying?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Are you going to?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Parents still together?
Do you work?
Private?
How are your grades?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
What do you think she wants?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
What's he doing up here?
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Madrigal's alive.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Does this offer include my partner?
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who do we interface with on their side?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Well, I've not brought them.
I'll be right after you.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Where's that?
Come on.
Jesus.
Holding hands?
No.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Have you got any gear on you?
Good luck, Spud.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Director?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
Why?
So?
That's hardly a substitute.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Great.
Sounds great, Swanney.
We go for a walk.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
Shuttle en route.
But the shuttle-
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Oh, God
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Goodnight, Spock.
I do not often think of the past.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
How do you know?
Spock.
What are you doing?
I trust your message was received?



Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Why not?
Sybok.
Are you embezzling?
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Did he say why?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
I want to go to his place.
For what?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
You said it.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
What, just the three of us?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Hey... you guys OK?
Feel what? You okay?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
New guy...
What do you think?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
We have to get off this beam!
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
What's this for?
What a team.  See you at eight.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Just hang a minute.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Give me the page.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Now what?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Hello, Harry.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Uh huh.  Okay.
Why did you continue to see him?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
My husband can't know about this.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Yeeaoowww!!
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Worse than Cairo?							*
Did you read the papers yesterday?
You can trust me completely.
What's happened?
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Who is this woman?
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
Has he looked through it yet?
Thanks a lot.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Like it?
What are your turn-ons?
Four hundred bucks.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I love Janis.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
What did he do to Arlene?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
No no no no no no no no no...
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Naw naw!
What?
Wannabee nigger...
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Money problems?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
The zoo.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Do you really mean it?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
What do you think, eightball?
He wants to talk ya.
Elliot.
Don't you?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Why does he trust you?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I'm really not very -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Keep it.
I've seen him.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
That Vietnam movie?
Suspect's words -
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
What was I sayin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Just put it in your purse.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Women will want to get to know you...
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What kind of information?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
The gun! ... I lost it
Just like that?  You were in prison?
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Germs?!
What....???
What...???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
That a fact?
You afraid of the dark?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Nope.  Darrell.
You own this place?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Please, just leave the car alone.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Do you have to call me that?
No, I've got it.
Wasn't nothing.
It's nothing.  Really.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
What happens if you lose?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Nice place you got here.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Beautiful?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
You love him?
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
Is it pretty?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
You got a suitcase?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
To get my car.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
John!
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
I'm a solid man.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Would you?
Hungry?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
That's a bit much.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Nooo!
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
I call the policia.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
Hell no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell is this!?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Say, what happened to your hand?
I'm a solid man.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would you?
What can I do for you, lad?
You meant it.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
I came for Grace.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
But you was going to fight for me.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You Harlin?
Hey.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
I got it.
You've been around.
What happens when you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Are there snakes out here?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You mean the Shaman?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
What about us?
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace ... Grace?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
I busted my leg!
Where ya goin'?
One way, or round trip?
Genuine Draft?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Once again please?
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Oh shit...
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Quick.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
When?
Why'd you do that?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.
I'm sleeping in my room.
I'm not scared.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
I'll just shoot him once.
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Did you get up from your seat?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Is this a religious thing?
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
I thought... you was an angel.
Yeah. See?
Books. He's my biographer.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I could run off them whores.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Like I said, I...
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
The... Duck of Death.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
William Munny, yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Been gone near three years now.
Three ways, I figured.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Finish him, Ned.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yup.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
I trust you, Bill.
Wha... what f-for?
You could have it. All of it.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
I seen him.
Easy, Bill.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Three.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
More.
Fuck you.
His pistol must of jammed.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
They just said they wanted time.
I know who he is.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Why don't you just calm down'
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I'11 be alright.
What-are they speaking?
You set up the line-up.
What about Redfoot?
The answer is no.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You got him wrong.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
You're stalling, Verbal.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
You're not safe on your own.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Just now...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
Exception!
Continental Casualty...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Hello, I'm calling from...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
I have to talk to you.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
Admittance form is wrong.
Been a long time, huh...?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I just saw her.
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Nothing.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
What do you want to know?
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
About three years.
Then will you for me?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Well?
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Where are you going?
We're going up the tower.
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Please drink your coffee.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
How old?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Do you hear anything?
And no birds sing.
Would you know the room?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Yes.
Why?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
You believe that I love you?
Oh, yes!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I had to quit, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
From that music.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
My... the acrophobia.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Out. I've got things to do.
Is she pretty?
Midge!
Around.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
What's that?
I said how's it going?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What are you doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Just stop.
How do you figure?
So that's what we're doing.
Don't talk to me about character.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
I won't do it.
My god.
So. When is the wedding.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
What is it?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
She's dead. Call somebody!
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Easy Boyd.
I said, what have we done?
What?
I just want to get married.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Okay fine.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
Take Mexico.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Are we supposed to?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Why did you forget the tent check?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
He's a great chef.
How much?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Just a bit of organizing.
Where are you?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Don't even.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
That ought to be about the end of that.
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
You alright?
Pup corn?
"You Send Me."
The post-Vegas Man.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Stop this, stop this.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Are there many windows?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Take me there.
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Yes, it is.
Never.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Unfortunately ...
Let me pass!
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
Me?
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
She's mad.
So, Ramona!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
Miss Viridiana ...
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Mother?
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Forgive me if I have offended you.
What about you, Manuel?
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
What happened when he was 17?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Who said that?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Don't worry about it, all right?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Real effective security...
Which way?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
The symphony of collision...
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
What if he's busy tonight?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
What can it hurt.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...this is a snappy song....
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
<u>Do</u> it...
Twenty thousand dollars.
Yes
...they sound what?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
We'll be back tonight.
...what's the Long View?
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...uh huh...
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Oh, God...
Pride of a job-well-done...
That's not bad at all.
Wilfred.
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Hello...?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews. 
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
My name is Ronald Brean.
What's on your mind?
Why do people go to war?
Would you go to War to do that? 
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
You can't have a war without an enemy.
W...what?
What?
The War ain't over. 
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
The Albanian Campaign.
...what happened...?
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
I'm tired.
Show Must Go On.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
Black...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
It's tough to rhyme.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
Jim Belushi...?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Oh huh...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
A wider option of what?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
... That's what you told us to say.
...if I had your looks, better.
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
What's going on?
The stock's going to Pluto!
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
The FAA announcement.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Whatever night you like.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...thanks Natalie.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
What if they call him?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So what's the problem?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
How do you know?
My home number's on the back...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
What the hell do you want?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Hi.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Anyone else not coming?
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
What?
Why is he worried?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  Please.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
What's your name?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
Wow.
He was so pissed.
She got it.  Turned it down.
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Jody--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
It's niiice.
Know what I think?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Okay.  Okay.
Adamant?
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I don't know.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Jody he was lying.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
If you have to work...
How are you?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Of what?
Did she say that?
Remember how we were?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
Norman, you have to look at this!
Hi.
Yep.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
You didn't?
Our house.
Dressed?
Tonight?
I don't need a shrink.
What are you doing out here?
Who did?
How did you--
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I may have seen her on campus.
It's Madison Fra--
Ow!
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Your wife...
"You know..."
That's not what I'm sayi--
I tried to break it off!
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
What is it...?
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
If that were true, I would not be here.
Do not tell me that!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
No!
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
you're very --- different.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Too much... too fast...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Stop it.
Seems more like a year than a month.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
You know...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
What about your work back home...?
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
You did that, didn't you...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Rowan Mayfair.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I heard something like that
Sounds good - thank you
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?

Do you take sugar?

So what do you do?
I don't know
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of

How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
What's wrong?
Yes...
First finish your tea...
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
What's wrong with you?
That's good
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
Sugar?
ANGEL...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Hurry.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
You're way ahead of me again?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
You do know how to drive?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Can you believe that was me?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
My legacy.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Me?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I mean my father.
That's probably my office.
He's on the move?
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Tell me more.
Do you trust me, Julie?
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
You called the cops on us?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
What are you doing?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How you doing, Artie?
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Then what?
Try, Kelly.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You saw the news today?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
That bothers you?
About a year ago.
No.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Are you crazy, Ray?
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Don't forget the car wash.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Hello?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Davy.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
But she ran away.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
How...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
No.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
That's a lot of butler.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Know what this is?
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
What's this?
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
There's only seventy-eight.
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Anyone?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You've... done... this... before.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
The first.
Easy now.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
You're chasing a dream.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
I'll help you...!
She's a bird, Willow.
I don't know, Willow.
You must learn magic.
How am I gonna do that?
Ouch!!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Are they going to kill you?
What are you going to do?
Are you really ever coming back?
Amish.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
What's your first move?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Whacking?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
How long?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Buttons are Hochmut.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
The... bullets?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Sure.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Anybody know about this?
I got there late, John.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
You hear me?
You know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Good morning.
God, Fred...
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I am not a child.
No, Rachel...
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
He's not in this building.
Is this where we're going?
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
...didn't you?
Ahh!  Ah!
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Are you ready now?
Oh --
...room --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh --
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Dorothy!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
...don't talk.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
...free!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
The other side....
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Yeah.
What happened?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
No, her dog!
No, sir!
That's right.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
-- Ruined my exit!
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Who’s she?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
It’s just a scratch.
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
She’ll get over it.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
No!  It will cave in!
Then take me with you.
...what?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
So you killed your father.
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Warm.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Blake?  Dead?
Jon --
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
His what?
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Laurie --
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
What the hell -- ?
They're practically on us . . .
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Dan -- what do we do now?
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What caused it?
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
New information.
What is this place?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Like what?
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Go to hell!
What are you?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Aren't you afraid?
Where's he headed?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
What...?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
What are you talking about?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Where are we going?
You designed this yourself?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Surprised?
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
I hope you like large weddings.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Ready, darling?
I suppose you're right.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Well... we'll see.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Vermicelli.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
And do you also say Fro dereck?
I see.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
I want that brain.
It's always been one of my favorite names.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
I'd be so nervous.
Give him the sedative!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Yes, I know.
Are you ready for me?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Look how far we've come.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
